# Agile methodology 
is a set of principles for software development under which requirements and solutions evolve through the collaborative effort of self-organizing and cross-functional teams. It advocates adaptive planning, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continual improvement, and it encourages flexible responses to change.

The Agile Manifesto, introduced in 2001, lays out the key values and principles behind this approach. Here are the four core values of Agile:

1. **Individuals and interactions** over processes and tools:
   - Agile methodologies place a premium on the people doing the work and how they work together. Tools and processes are important, but they are secondary to teamwork and collaboration.

2. **Working software** over comprehensive documentation:
   - While documentation is important, Agile methodologies prioritize delivering functional software to the customer. The idea is to provide something tangible and working early and to update it frequently based on feedback.

3. **Customer collaboration** over contract negotiation:
   - Agile methods encourage continuous interaction with the customer throughout the development process. The goal is to understand the customer's needs and develop a product that satisfies those needs, rather than strictly adhering to an initial contract.

4. **Responding to change** over following a plan:
   - Agile methodologies are designed to accommodate changes to requirements as the project evolves. The ability to adapt to changing needs is seen as more valuable than sticking to a fixed plan.

In addition to these values, the Agile Manifesto also includes 12 principles that support the Agile approach. These principles outline the approach to software development that encourages flexibility, collaboration, and customer satisfaction. Here they are:

1. **Customer satisfaction through early and continuous delivery of valuable software**: Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference for the shorter timescale.

2. **Welcome changing requirements, even late in development**: Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.

3. **Deliver working software frequently**: Release functioning software regularly, from a few weeks to a few months, with a preference for shorter intervals.

4. **Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project**: Collaboration between business stakeholders and developers is essential throughout the project to create the most valuable and relevant product.

5. **Build projects around motivated individuals**: Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.

6. **The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation**: Direct communication is key for clear and efficient collaboration.

7. **Working software is the primary measure of progress**: The main indicator of success in an Agile project is the delivery of functional software.

8. **Agile processes promote sustainable development**: The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.

9. **Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility**: Regular focus on improving technical aspects and design improves the agility of the team.

10. **Simplicity—the art of maximizing the amount of work not done—is essential**: Focus on what is necessary and eliminate unnecessary work to streamline the development process.

11. **The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams**: When teams have control over their work and organization, they are more likely to come up with the most effective solutions.

12. **At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly**: Continuous improvement through reflection and adaptation is a core aspect of Agile.

These principles guide the implementation of Agile methodologies and help teams to be more responsive to change, deliver value more frequently, and build better products that meet the needs of customers and users.

Some of the most popular Agile frameworks include:

- **Scrum**: A framework that uses fixed-length iterations called sprints, with predefined roles such as the Scrum Master and [Product Owner](product-owner.md), and ceremonies like daily stand-ups, sprint planning, and sprint reviews.

- **Kanban**: A method that focuses on visualizing the workflow on a Kanban board and limiting the amount of work in progress to improve flow and reduce cycle time.

- **Extreme Programming (XP)**: A methodology that emphasizes technical excellence and practices like pair programming, test-driven development (TDD), and continuous integration.

- **Lean Software Development**: Inspired by lean manufacturing practices, this approach focuses on delivering value to the customer by eliminating waste and optimizing processes.

Agile methodologies are contrasted with traditional waterfall models, where each phase of development happens in linear sequence and typically does not overlap. Agile's iterative approach allows for more flexibility and adaptability throughout the project lifecycle.#
