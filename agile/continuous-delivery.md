# Continuous Delivery
is a software development practice where changes to the code are automatically built, tested, and deployed to production. This ensures that new features and bug fixes are quickly and safely released to users.

It involves a set of practices and tools that enable teams to release software changes to production at any time, with high confidence and low risk. This is achieved through a combination of automated testing, continuous integration, and deployment pipelines.

Example:
1. A developer makes a code change and commits it to a version control system like Git.
2. A Continuous Integration (CI) server automatically builds the code, runs automated tests, and generates a build artifact.
3. The build artifact is deployed to a staging environment for further testing and quality assurance.
4. If the tests pass in the staging environment, the code is automatically deployed to production.
5. The production environment is monitored for issues, and any problems are quickly identified and fixed.

This process is repeated every time a code change is made, ensuring that the software is always up-to-date and of high quality.
