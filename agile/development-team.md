# Development Team 
is a group of professionals who work together to deliver the product increments. The Development Team is one of the three core roles within Scrum, alongside the [Scrum Master](scrum-master.md) and the [Product Owner](product-owner.md).

### Characteristics of the Development Team:

- **Cross-functional**: Members have all the skills necessary to create a product Increment.
- **Self-organizing**: No one (not even the [Scrum Master](scrum-master.md) tells the Development Team how to turn the Product Backlog into Increments of potentially releasable functionality.
- **Collaborative**: The team members work together closely on a daily basis to ensure the product is developed according to the agreed-upon sprint goals.
- **Accountable**: As a whole, the team is accountable for the work they agree to complete within a sprint. Individual members are not solely responsible for specific aspects of the work.
- **Size**: Scrum teams are typically small to maintain simplicity and communication. The recommended size is between 3 and 9 members.

### Responsibilities of the Development Team:

1. **Creating Product Increments**: The team is responsible for delivering "Done" increments of software at the end of each sprint.

2. **Participating in Scrum Ceremonies**: This includes the Daily Scrum, Sprint Planning, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.

3. **Estimating User Stories**: The Development Team is involved in the estimation process during Sprint Planning.

4. **Self-Managing**: The team organizes itself and its work autonomously, deciding who does what, when, and how.

5. **Quality Control**: The team is responsible for ensuring the quality of the product through good practices, such as automated testing, code reviews, and continuous integration.

6. **Technical Problem Solving**: The team needs to solve complex problems that arise during development.

7. **Continuous Improvement**: The team reflects on their performance and process during the Sprint Retrospective and looks for ways to improve.

The Development Team works closely with the Product Owner to clarify requirements and ensure that the work they are doing aligns with the product vision and customer needs. They also work with the Scrum Master who helps remove impediments and facilitates the Scrum process.

In Scrum, the Development Team is not made up of sub-teams or hierarchies. There are no titles for Development Team members, regardless of the work being performed by the person; there are no exceptions to this rule. This encourages a level of flexibility and collective ownership that is central to the Scrum philosophy. Members may have specialized skills and areas of expertise, but accountability belongs to the Development Team as a whole.
