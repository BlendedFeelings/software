# Epic
in [Agile](agile-methodology.md) methodology is a large body of work that can be broken down into smaller tasks (called [user stories](user-story.md)) based on specific requirements or needs. Epics are typically used to organize work and capture broad initiatives that will be refined and broken down into more actionable and manageable pieces.

An epic is essentially a container for a significant solution that can take several sprints, or even months, to complete. Epics are often used to group related [user stories](user-story.md) to streamline the development process and track progress on larger goals.

### Characteristics of Epics:

- **Broad in Scope**: Epics are usually too large to be completed in a single sprint and thus need to be broken down into smaller user stories.
- **Long-Term**: They represent work that can span multiple sprints and involve a complex set of interrelated tasks.
- **High-Level Requirements**: Epics capture high-level requirements or objectives without going into the detail that is typical for user stories.
- **Strategic Initiatives**: They often align with strategic goals or initiatives and provide a way to track the progress of these larger efforts.

### Examples of Epics:

Here are a few examples of epics in different domains:

1. **E-Commerce Platform Overhaul**: This epic could include a series of user stories related to redesigning the user interface, improving the checkout process, integrating a new payment gateway, and enhancing the mobile user experience.

2. **Implementing a New Customer Support System**: This epic would encompass user stories around selecting a new support platform, migrating existing data, training staff, and deploying the system.

3. **Developing a New Mobile Application**: An epic that includes user stories for initial market research, design of the app interface, development of core functionalities, beta testing, and the app's launch.

4. **Regulatory Compliance Update**: For a company facing new regulations, an epic might involve user stories for auditing current practices, implementing required changes, and training staff on new compliance procedures.

### Managing Epics:

- **Prioritization**: Epics are prioritized based on their value to the business, the cost of implementation, and their urgency or strategic importance.
- **Breakdown**: Once an epic is prioritized for work, it is broken down into user stories that fit into sprints. This breakdown involves creating actionable, testable, and estimable tasks.
- **Tracking**: Progress on epics is tracked to provide visibility into the completion of the larger goals they represent. This can be done using Agile project management tools or boards that show how individual user stories contribute to the epic's progress.

In summary, epics are a way to manage and organize large-scale work in Agile projects. They help teams maintain a focus on big-picture goals while working on the smaller tasks that contribute to those objectives. Epics are broken down into user stories when the team is ready to start working on them, allowing for more detailed planning and execution.
