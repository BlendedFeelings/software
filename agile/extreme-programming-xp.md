# Extreme Programming (XP) 
is an [Agile](agile-methodology.md) software development framework that aims to produce higher quality software, and higher quality of life for the development team. XP is the most specific of the [Agile](agile-methodology.md) frameworks regarding appropriate engineering practices for software development.

XP was created by Kent Beck during his work on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System (C3) payroll project. It emphasizes customer satisfaction and places a high value on adaptive planning, frequent releases, and a flexible approach to changes, even late in the development process.

Key practices and principles of Extreme Programming include:

### Core Values

1. **Communication**: Team members and stakeholders are encouraged to communicate frequently and clearly to ensure alignment and understanding.
   
2. **Simplicity**: The focus is on what is needed now and avoiding over-engineering, which can lead to wasted effort and complexity.
   
3. **Feedback**: Regular feedback from the system, the customer, and the team helps ensure that the product is developing in the right direction.
   
4. **Courage**: Team members are encouraged to take on challenges, make changes, and stand up for quality and the XP practices.
   
5. **Respect**: Team members respect each other, their unique contributions, and the requirements of the project.

### Key Practices

1. **The Planning Game**: A collaborative planning process that involves all stakeholders, with the goal of producing a plan that leads to the delivery of high-value features first.
   
2. **Small Releases**: The software is developed in small increments with new releases being made frequently, allowing the customer to benefit from the software earlier.
   
3. **Customer Tests**: Requirements are defined by the customer in terms of automated acceptance tests that must be passed for the feature to be considered complete.
   
4. **Simple Design**: The design is kept as simple as possible at any given moment. Extra complexity is removed as soon as it's discovered.
   
5. **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Developers write tests for a new feature before they write the code to implement the feature.
   
6. **Refactoring**: Continuous improvement of the code to make it simpler and clearer, without changing its functionality, to improve the design and remove technical debt.
   
7. **Pair Programming**: Two programmers work together at one workstation; one writes code while the other reviews each line of code as it's typed in.
   
8. **Collective Code Ownership**: No single person "owns" a module; any developer can work on any part of the codebase at any time.
   
9. **Continuous Integration**: Code changes are integrated into the main branch many times per day and verified by an automated build to detect integration errors as quickly as possible.
   
10. **Sustainable Pace**: Teams should work at a pace that they can sustain indefinitely, avoiding burnout and maintaining high-quality standards.
   
11. **On-Site Customer**: A representative of the end-users, the customer is available full time to answer questions, provide requirements, and set priorities.

Extreme Programming encourages frequent "releases" in short development cycles, which improves productivity and introduces checkpoints where new customer requirements can be adopted. XP's practices are designed to improve the quality of the software and the quality of life for the development team, as well as to adapt to changing requirements at any point in the project lifecycle.
