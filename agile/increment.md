# Increment 
in the context of Scrum and other Agile methodologies, is the sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a Sprint and all previous Sprints. Essentially, it's the step-by-step growth of a product, where each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly tested, ensuring that all Increments work together.

### Characteristics of an Increment:

- **Potentially Shippable**: Each Increment is required to be in a useable condition regardless of whether the [Product Owner](product-owner.md) decides to release it. It must meet the Scrum Team's definition of "Done," meaning it's potentially releasable to end-users and stakeholders.
- **Cumulative**: An Increment builds on the previous Increments within a release cycle, cumulating in a version of the product that contains all the work from the current and previous Sprints.
- **Quality Assurance**: Before an Increment is considered "Done," it must meet the quality standards set by the team. This often includes full integration testing, performance testing, and any other criteria the team or organization deems necessary for the product.
- **Definition of "Done"**: The criteria for what constitutes "Done" for an Increment is agreed upon by the Scrum Team. This shared understanding ensures transparency and quality.

### Purpose of an Increment:

- **Deliver Value**: Each Increment is a step towards delivering value to the customer or user. It represents a tangible, working version of the product that includes new features or improvements.
- **Feedback**: It provides a basis for feedback from stakeholders, which can be used to guide future development.
- **Progress Measurement**: The Increment is a means to measure the progress of the development effort over the course of the Sprint.

### Creating an Increment:

- **Development**: The Development Team works on the selected Product Backlog items during the Sprint, converting them into a working product Increment.
- **Integration**: The new functionality is integrated with the existing product, ensuring that everything works together seamlessly.
- **Testing**: The Increment is tested to ensure it meets the necessary quality standards and the Definition of "Done."

### Reviewing an Increment:

At the end of each Sprint, the Increment is presented to stakeholders during the Sprint Review. This event is an opportunity to inspect the Increment, gather feedback, and adjust the Product Backlog if necessary.

The Increment is a core concept in Agile development, embodying the iterative and incremental approach to delivering software. It ensures that the Scrum Team is always working towards a product that can be released to the market at any time, thus supporting Agile's value of responding to change and delivering working software frequently.
