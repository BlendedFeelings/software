# Kanban 
is a popular [Agile](agile-methodology.md) framework that is used to manage work by balancing demands with available capacity and improving the handling of system-level bottlenecks. It comes from the Japanese word for "visual signal" or "card." Kanban was originally developed by Toyota to improve manufacturing efficiency and has since been adapted for knowledge work, such as software development and other business areas.

Kanban is based on three basic principles:

1. **Visualize Work**: Using a Kanban board, you can visualize the flow of work. This typically involves columns that represent different stages of the workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Done." Each item or task is represented by a card that moves across the board, providing a visual representation of the progress being made.

2. **Limit Work in Progress (WIP)**: By setting limits on the number of tasks that can be in a particular workflow state at one time, Kanban helps teams focus on completing tasks before taking on new ones. This prevents overloading the team and helps identify bottlenecks in the process.

3. **Enhance Flow**: The team pulls work as capacity permits, rather than work being pushed into the process when it's not ready. This helps ensure that work flows smoothly through the process and that the team is working at a sustainable pace.

In addition to these principles, Kanban promotes continuous collaboration and encourages active, ongoing learning and improvement by defining the best possible team workflow.

Key elements of Kanban include:

- **Kanban Board**: A visual representation of the work and workflow. It can be a physical board with sticky notes or a digital board using one of many available software tools.

- **Cards**: Visual representations of work items. Each card contains information about the task.

- **Columns**: Each column on the board represents a step in the workflow.

- **Work in Progress Limits**: These are the maximum number of cards that can be in one column at any given time.

- **Commitment Point**: The moment when a work item is picked from the backlog and moved onto the Kanban board, signifying that work has begun.

- **Delivery Point**: The stage at which a work item is considered done and is delivered or ready for delivery.

Kanban doesn't prescribe roles or ceremonies like Scrum; instead, it focuses on improving the flow of work and can be overlaid on existing processes. It is often used in conjunction with other Agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to enhance flexibility and responsiveness. The Kanban method is particularly well suited for teams that have a continuous flow of incoming work with varying priorities.
