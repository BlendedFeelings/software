# Lean Software Development (LSD) 
is an adaptation of lean manufacturing principles and practices to the software development domain. Adapted from the Toyota Production System, it is emerging with the support of a pro-lean subculture within the [Agile](agile-methodology.md) community. Lean offers a solid conceptual framework, values, and principles, as well as good practices, derived from experience, that support [Agile](agile-methodology.md) organizations.

Lean Software Development focuses on the creation of easily changeable software in a highly efficient and effective manner. It has the following key principles:

1. **Eliminate Waste**: The focus is on eliminating all activities that do not add value to the customer, such as unnecessary code or functionality, delays in the development process, unclear requirements, or bureaucracy.

2. **Amplify Learning**: The process of development should facilitate continual learning and improvement. This involves frequent iteration, prototyping, and the inclusion of feedback.

3. **Decide as Late as Possible**: Delaying decisions as much as possible until they can be made based on facts and not on uncertain assumptions and predictions. This allows for more flexible and informed decision-making.

4. **Deliver as Fast as Possible**: The quicker a product is developed and delivered without sacrificing quality, the faster feedback can be received, and incorporated into the next iteration.

5. **Empower the Team**: Providing the team with the environment and support they need and trust them to get the job done. This involves autonomy and encourages innovation and accountability.

6. **Build Integrity In**: Ensuring the system is robust and works well on all levels. This includes the user experience, the architecture, the code, and the final product.

7. **Optimize the Whole**: Focusing on the entire value stream to ensure that the product flows smoothly through all stages of development and delivery, rather than optimizing individual pieces of the system.

Lean Software Development also emphasizes the importance of respect for people â€“ both those who are part of the development team and the customers. This respect is shown by listening to them, understanding their problems and needs, and creating a product that truly serves them.

Lean principles have been applied to various aspects of software development, including project management, product development, and software development processes. By focusing on value and efficiency, Lean Software Development aims to deliver high-quality software in a timely manner and with a focus on customer needs.
