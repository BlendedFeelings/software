# Planning Game 
is an essential element of [Extreme Programming (XP)](extreme-programming-xp.md), which is a collaborative approach to software development that emphasizes customer satisfaction, simplicity, and the ability to adapt to changing requirements. The Planning Game is a meeting where the development team, together with business representatives (often the Product Owner or customer), determine the scope and direction of the project over the next iteration.

The Planning Game consists of two main activities: Release Planning and Iteration Planning.

### Release Planning

Release Planning is a longer-term planning horizon where the team and stakeholders decide what should be accomplished over the next few months. This typically includes:

- **Setting the Vision**: Defining the goals and desired outcomes for the release.
- **Prioritizing Features**: The Product Owner or customer presents and prioritizes features, often written as user stories, based on their business value.
- **Estimation**: The development team estimates the effort required for each feature. These estimates help in understanding the amount of work that can be taken on.
- **Planning**: Based on priorities and estimates, the team and stakeholders create a release plan that outlines which features will be developed for the next release.

### Iteration Planning

Iteration Planning is a more immediate and detailed planning session for the upcoming iteration (typically one to three weeks in XP). During this meeting:

- **User Stories Selection**: The team selects a set of user stories from the top of the prioritized backlog that they believe they can commit to completing in the iteration.
- **Task Breakdown**: Each user story is broken down into specific tasks. This helps clarify what needs to be done and allows for more accurate estimates of the iteration workload.
- **Task Estimation and Assignment**: The team estimates how much time each task will take and begins to sign up for tasks. In XP, tasks are not usually assigned; rather, team members volunteer for tasks they feel they can complete.
- **Commitment**: The team commits to the set of tasks they believe they can deliver by the end of the iteration, creating a shared understanding and agreement on the iteration goals.

The Planning Game is characterized by:

- **Collaboration**: It's a joint effort between the development team and the business representatives, ensuring that both perspectives are considered in the planning process.
- **Adaptability**: Plans can be revised as new information is discovered, allowing the team to adapt to changes quickly.
- **Transparency**: The process is open and visible to all stakeholders, promoting trust and clear communication.
- **Simplicity**: The focus is on delivering value in small, manageable increments rather than getting bogged down by over-planning.

The Planning Game is an iterative process itself, with regular reviews and adjustments made as the project progresses. It helps ensure that the development work is closely aligned with business needs and that the team remains flexible to adapt to changing requirements.
