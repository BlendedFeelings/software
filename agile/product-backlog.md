# Product Backlog 
is a fundamental concept in the [Scrum](sprint.md) framework and [Agile](agile-methodology.md) methodologies. It is an ordered list of everything that is known to be needed in the product. The Product Backlog is dynamic; it constantly changes to identify what the product needs to be appropriate, competitive, and useful. It is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

### Characteristics of the Product Backlog:

- **Comprehensive**: The Product Backlog contains all the features, functions, requirements, enhancements, and fixes that constitute the changes to be made to the product in future releases.
- **Prioritized**: Items in the Product Backlog are ordered by priority, with the most important items at the top and the least important items at the bottom. The priority is determined by the Product Owner, often based on factors such as value to the customer, cost, risk, and dependencies.
- **Dynamic**: The Product Backlog is never complete. As long as a product exists, its Product Backlog also exists. As new needs are discovered, they are added to the Product Backlog. Items can also be changed or removed as necessary.
- **Estimation**: Each item in the Product Backlog is usually estimated to give an idea of the effort involved. This helps with sprint planning and release planning.
- **Refinement**: The Product Backlog is continuously refined to ensure that the Backlog contains the right items, that they are clearly expressed, and that the items at the top of the Backlog are ready for delivery.
- **Transparent**: Everyone involved in the project should have access to the Product Backlog for transparency and understanding of what is coming up and what the team will work on next.

### Roles and Responsibilities:

- **Product Owner**: The Product Owner is responsible for the Product Backlog, including its content, availability, and ordering. They must ensure that the Product Backlog is visible, transparent, and clear to all, and shows what the Scrum Team will work on next.

### Product Backlog Items (PBIs):

- **User Stories**: A common format for expressing Product Backlog items is the user story, which describes a feature from the perspective of the end-user.
- **Bugs/Defects**: Issues that need to be addressed.
- **Technical Debt**: Work that needs to be done to improve the codebase.
- **Knowledge Acquisition**: Research, discovery, and exploration tasks that help the team better understand what needs to be built.
- **Enablers**: Infrastructure or architectural changes that are necessary to facilitate future delivery of customer-facing features.

The Product Backlog is a living artifact that captures the known requirements for the product. It is the starting point for planning any Sprint, and it evolves as the product and the environment in which it will be used evolves. The ongoing process of adding, prioritizing, and refining the Product Backlog is known as Product Backlog management.
