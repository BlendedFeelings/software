# Scrum Team 
is the fundamental unit of Scrum, an Agile framework for developing, delivering, and sustaining complex products. It is designed to optimize flexibility, creativity, and productivity. The Scrum Team consists of a [Product Owner](product-owner.md), the Development Team, and a Scrum Master. Scrum Teams are self-organizing and cross-functional; they choose how best to accomplish their work, rather than being directed by others outside the team.

### Characteristics of a Scrum Team:

- **Self-Organizing**: The team members decide internally how to organize their work to achieve the Sprint Goal and create the Increments.
- **Cross-Functional**: The team has all the competencies needed to accomplish the work without depending on others not part of the team.
- **Collaborative**: Scrum Teams work closely together and regularly reflect on how to become more effective, and then adjust accordingly.
- **Small and Focused**: Scrum Teams are typically small to maintain simplicity and communication. The recommended size is between 3 and 9 members, not including the Scrum Master and Product Owner if they are not actively working on items in the Sprint Backlog.

### Roles within the Scrum Team:

1. **Product Owner**: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product and the work of the Development Team. The Product Owner is the sole person responsible for managing the Product Backlog.

2. **Development Team**: Professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable Increment of "Done" product at the end of each Sprint. They are structured and empowered by the organization to organize and manage their own work.

3. **Scrum Master**: Acts as a servant leader to the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps those outside the Scrum Team understand which of their interactions with the Scrum Team are helpful and which aren’t. The Scrum Master helps everyone change these interactions to maximize the value created by the Scrum Team.

### Responsibilities of the Scrum Team:

- **Delivering Increments**: The Scrum Team is responsible for delivering potentially releasable Increments of software at the end of each Sprint.
- **Adhering to Scrum**: The Scrum Team follows the Scrum framework, its values, principles, and practices.
- **Sprint Participation**: All members of the Scrum Team participate in the Scrum events: Sprint Planning, Daily Scrum, Sprint Review, and Sprint Retrospective.
- **Continuous Improvement**: The Scrum Team is responsible for improving the product, the team, and the working environment.

The Scrum Team works in a series of Sprints—time-boxed iterations that last no longer than one month each. During each Sprint, the team creates a potentially shippable product Increment. The roles within the Scrum Team are designed to work in concert to create transparency, inspect the work, and adapt as necessary, following the empirical process control theory upon which Scrum is founded.
