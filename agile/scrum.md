# Scrum 
is an [Agile](agile-methodology.md) framework that is used to manage and control complex software and product development using iterative and incremental practices. It's one of the most widely implemented Agile methodologies. Scrum is designed to add energy, focus, clarity, and transparency to the project team's process.

Here are the key components of Scrum:

### Roles

- **Product Owner**: Responsible for maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Development Team. They manage the product backlog and ensure that everyone understands the work items in the backlog.

- **Scrum Master**: Acts as a servant leader and coach for the Scrum Team. The Scrum Master helps everyone understand Scrum theory, practices, rules, and values and ensures that the Scrum process is followed.

- **Development Team**: A group of professionals who do the work of delivering a potentially releasable increment of "Done" product at the end of each sprint. They are self-organizing and cross-functional.

### Artifacts

- **Product Backlog**: An ordered list of everything that is needed in the product, and is the single source of requirements for any changes to be made to the product.

- **Sprint Backlog**: A set of items selected from the Product Backlog to be completed during the sprint, plus a plan for delivering the product increment and realizing the sprint goal.

- **Increment**: The sum of all the Product Backlog items completed during a sprint and all previous sprints. At the end of a sprint, the new increment must be "Done," which means it must be in a useable condition and meet the Scrum team's definition of "Done."

### Events (Ceremonies)

- **Sprint**: A time-boxed period when a specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. Sprints are usually 2-4 weeks long.

- **Sprint Planning**: The event that initiates the sprint by laying out the work to be performed for the sprint. This is a collaborative effort involving the Scrum Master, the [Product Owner](product-owner.md), and the entire Development Team.

- **Daily Scrum (Stand-Up)**: A 15-minute time-boxed event for the Development Team to synchronize activities and create a plan for the next 24 hours.

- **Sprint Review**: Held at the end of a sprint to inspect the increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. During this meeting, the Scrum Team and stakeholders collaborate about what was done in the sprint.

- **Sprint Retrospective**: An opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint.

Scrum is underpinned by the values of commitment, courage, focus, openness, and respect. These values guide the team in its decision-making and interactions.

Scrum's agility comes from the ability to adapt to emerging business realities; the iterative process allows for frequent reassessment and the Scrum roles ensure a dedicated focus on the quality and value of the product being developed.
