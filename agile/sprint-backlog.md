# Sprint Backlog 
is a subset of the [Product Backlog](product-backlog.md) and is one of the key artifacts in the [Scrum](scrum.md) framework. It is the set of [Product Backlog](product-backlog.md) items selected for the [Sprint](sprint.md), plus a plan for delivering the product Increment and realizing the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next Increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.

### Characteristics of the Sprint Backlog:

- **Commitment**: The [Development Team](development-team.md) commits to completing the items in the Sprint Backlog by the end of the Sprint.
- **Flexible**: While the Sprint Goal is fixed, the Sprint Backlog can be updated during the Sprint as more is learned. However, this does not mean that the scope of the Sprint can be increased; rather, it means that the details of how to achieve the Sprint Goal can be adjusted.
- **Visible**: The Sprint Backlog should be visible to everyone in the team to promote transparency and collaborative work.
- **Owned by the Development Team**: The Development Team is solely responsible for the Sprint Backlog. Only they can change it during the Sprint.

### Components of the Sprint Backlog:

1. **Sprint Goal**: The objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of the selected Product Backlog items. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

2. **Selected Product Backlog Items**: These are the items that the Development Team forecasts they can complete during the Sprint to meet the Sprint Goal.

3. **Plan for Delivering the Increment**: This includes the tasks that the Development Team identifies as necessary to complete the Product Backlog items they have selected for the Sprint.

### Purpose of the Sprint Backlog:

- **Guidance**: The Sprint Backlog guides the Development Team on what to work on during the Sprint.
- **Flexibility**: It allows the Development Team to manage their own work and re-plan their work in the middle of a Sprint.
- **Focus**: It helps the Development Team focus on the goal of the Sprint and the tasks necessary to achieve that goal.

### Creation and Maintenance:

- **Creation**: The Sprint Backlog is created during the Sprint Planning meeting. The Development Team selects the Product Backlog items they can commit to completing during the Sprint and then breaks down those items into tasks.
- **Maintenance**: The Development Team updates the Sprint Backlog throughout the Sprint as they learn more about the work needed to achieve the Sprint Goal. The Sprint Backlog is often updated during the Daily Scrum.

The Sprint Backlog is a highly visible, real-time picture of the work that the Development Team plans to accomplish during the Sprint, and it belongs solely to the Development Team. As the developers work through the Sprint, they are encouraged to update the Sprint Backlog to reflect the current state of their work and to help them organize themselves to meet the Sprint Goal.
