# Sprint Goal 
is a concise statement of the purpose of the [Sprint](sprint.md) and what it aims to achieve. It is an objective set by the Scrum Team during the [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning.md) meeting and provides a focus for the [Development Team](development-team.md) on why it is building the Increment. The Sprint Goal gives the team guidance and flexibility in terms of the detailed work needed to achieve the objective.

### Characteristics of a Sprint Goal:

- **Co-created**: The Sprint Goal is collaboratively created by both the [Product Owner](product-owner.md) and the [Development Team](development-team.md).
- **Guiding Objective**: It provides a shared aim for the [Development Team](development-team.md) and helps them understand the context of their work.
- **Flexible**: While the Sprint Goal is fixed and remains constant, the functionality implemented within the Sprint can be negotiated as the team learns more.
- **Motivational**: The Sprint Goal should energize the team and create a sense of purpose and motivation.
- **Commitment**: The [Development Team](development-team.md) commits to meeting the Sprint Goal by the end of the Sprint.

### Purpose of the Sprint Goal:

- **Focus**: It helps the [Development Team](development-team.md) focus on a common objective and not just on completing a set of isolated tasks.
- **Coherence**: It ensures that the work of the [Development Team](development-team.md) is coherent and that the resulting Increment is meaningful.
- **Flexibility in Scope**: It allows for some flexibility within the Sprint regarding the exact work that will be performed, as long as it is aligned with the goal.
- **Decision-Making**: It guides the [Development Team](development-team.md) in making decisions about the functionality to develop and how to overcome challenges during the Sprint.

### Creating a Sprint Goal:

The Sprint Goal is crafted during the [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning.md) meeting. The process typically involves:

1. **Reviewing the Product Backlog**: The [Product Owner](product-owner.md) presents the top items on the Product Backlog to the team.
2. **Negotiation**: The [Development Team](development-team.md) and the [Product Owner](product-owner.md) negotiate which items from the Product Backlog will be included in the [Sprint](sprint.md) to meet the Sprint Goal.
3. **Formulation**: The team formulates the Sprint Goal, which provides a high-level objective for the [Sprint](sprint.md) and can be tied to one or more [Product Backlog](product-backlog.md) items.

### Example of a Sprint Goal:

For an e-commerce website, a Sprint Goal might be: "Enhance the checkout process to reduce cart abandonment and improve the user experience."

This goal would guide the [Development Team's](development-team.md) work throughout the Sprint, ensuring that all the selected Product Backlog items and the tasks created to support those items contribute to enhancing the checkout process.

The Sprint Goal is a critical part of the [Sprint](sprint.md) and is used to assess whether the Sprint has been successful during the Sprint Review. If the Sprint Goal has been met, the Sprint is considered successful, even if some Product Backlog items originally forecasted are not completed.
