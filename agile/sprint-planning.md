# Sprint Planning 
is a core event in the [Scrum](scrum.md) framework that marks the start of a Sprint. It is a collaborative effort involving the Scrum Team: the [Product Owner](product-owner.md), the [Development Team](development-team.md), and the [Scrum Master](scrum-master.md). The main goal of Sprint Planning is to define what can be delivered in the upcoming Sprint and how that work will be achieved.

### Duration of Sprint Planning

The duration of Sprint Planning is time-boxed to a maximum of eight hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. The rule of thumb is to allocate two hours of planning for each week of the Sprint duration (e.g., for a two-week Sprint, Sprint Planning would last no more than four hours).

### Activities during Sprint Planning

Sprint Planning is divided into two main parts:

1. **What to Work On**: The [Product Owner](product-owner.md) presents the top items on the Product Backlog to the team, explaining the objectives that the Sprint should achieve and the Product Backlog items that, if completed, would achieve the Sprint Goal. The Development Team then forecasts the functionality that will be developed during the Sprint. The Development Team has the final say on how much work they believe they can commit to completing during the Sprint.

2. **How to Get the Work Done**: Once the Development Team has selected the items for the Sprint, they need to figure out how to turn the Product Backlog items into a "Done" increment. This typically involves the team breaking down the items into tasks and estimating them. The [Product Owner](product-owner.md) is available to clarify the details and answer questions.

### Outcomes of Sprint Planning

- **Sprint Goal**: The Sprint Goal is an objective set for the Sprint that can be met through the implementation of the Product Backlog. It provides guidance to the Development Team on why it is building the Increment.

- **Sprint Backlog**: The Sprint Backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Development Team to complete during the Sprint in order to deliver the selected Product Backlog items and meet the Sprint Goal. It is a forecast by the Development Team about what functionality will be in the next increment and the work needed to deliver that functionality.

- **Sprint Plan**: The Sprint Plan is the result of the collaborative work during Sprint Planning and includes the Sprint Goal, the selected Product Backlog items, and the plan for delivering them.

The Sprint Planning meeting is crucial for setting the direction for the Sprint. It ensures that the team has a shared understanding of the tasks and goals before starting work. It also reinforces the principles of collaboration and commitment to goals, which are central to the Scrum framework.
