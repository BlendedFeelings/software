# Sprint Retrospective 
is one of the key events in the Scrum framework and is an opportunity for the Scrum Team to inspect itself and create a plan for improvements to be enacted during the next Sprint. It occurs after the Sprint Review and prior to the next Sprint Planning meeting.

### Duration of the Sprint Retrospective

The Sprint Retrospective is time-boxed to a maximum of three hours for a one-month Sprint. For shorter Sprints, the event is usually shorter. For example, for a two-week Sprint, the Retrospective might last 1.5 hours.

### Participants

The Sprint Retrospective involves the entire Scrum Team: the [Product Owner](product-owner.md), the Development Team, and the Scrum Master.

### Purpose of the Sprint Retrospective

The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to:

- **Inspect**: The team examines how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, process, and tools.
- **Adapt**: The team identifies and agrees on the most important things that went well and potential improvements.
- **Create a Plan**: The team creates a plan for implementing improvements to the way they do their work.

### Activities during the Sprint Retrospective

1. **Data Gathering**: The team reflects on the past Sprint, discussing what was successful and what problems they encountered.
2. **Generating Insights**: Team members discuss the data gathered to understand the underlying reasons for successes and failures.
3. **Deciding What to Improve**: The team selects a small number of improvements that they believe will make a significant impact on their efficiency and effectiveness.
4. **Creating Action Plans**: For each improvement, the team creates an action plan for how it will be implemented in the next Sprint.

### Outcomes of the Sprint Retrospective

- **Improvement Actions**: Concrete plans for improving the team's process, which are added to the Sprint Backlog for the next Sprint.
- **Team Commitment**: The team commits to the improvements and how they will apply them to the next Sprint.
- **Continuous Improvement**: By regularly examining their work and process, the Scrum Team develops a culture of continuous improvement.

The Sprint Retrospective is a critical inspect-and-adapt opportunity for the Scrum Team. It allows the team to reflect on their dynamics, the processes they use, and the tools they work with. The Retrospective is key to the Scrum principle of empiricism, providing a structured way for the team to focus on continuous improvement and to increase their productivity and the quality of the product.
