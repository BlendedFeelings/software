# Sprint Review 
is one of the key events in the [Scrum](sprint.md) framework, held at the end of each [Sprint](sprint.md) to inspect the Increment and adapt the Product Backlog if needed. It is an informal meeting, not a status meeting, and its purpose is to elicit feedback and foster collaboration.

### Duration of the Sprint Review

The Sprint Review is time-boxed to a maximum of four hours for a one-month [Sprint](sprint.md). For shorter [Sprints](sprint.md), the event is usually shorter.

### Participants

The Sprint Review includes the Scrum Team ([Product Owner](product-owner.md), Development Team, and Scrum Master) and key stakeholders invited by the [Product Owner](product-owner.md).

### Purpose of the Sprint Review

The Sprint Review provides an opportunity for the Scrum Team to demonstrate what was accomplished during the [Sprint](sprint.md). It also allows the team to get feedback and suggestions from stakeholders, which can then be incorporated into the next [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning.md).

### Activities during the Sprint Review

1. **Demonstrating the Work Done**: The Development Team presents the work they have "Done" during the [Sprint](sprint.md), which means showing the new functionality and the Increment to the stakeholders.

2. **Collaboration**: Stakeholders, the [Product Owner](product-owner.md), and the Development Team discuss what was done and not done, and they collaborate on what to do next. This helps everyone to understand the current state of the product and the market it serves.

3. **Adapting the Product Backlog**: The [Product Owner](product-owner.md) discusses the Product Backlog as it stands. They may project likely completion dates based on progress to date. The entire group collaborates on what to do next, so that the Sprint Review provides valuable input to subsequent [Sprint Planning](sprint-planning.md).

4. **Reviewing the Market**: The [Product Owner](product-owner.md) talks about the current marketplace, competitor developments, and any changes in potential customer or user needs. This discussion helps the Scrum Team understand the context for the work done.

### Outcomes of the Sprint Review

- **Feedback**: The team receives feedback that they can use to improve the product and the process.
- **Updated Product Backlog**: The Product Backlog may be adjusted to include new user stories or to reprioritize existing ones based on the feedback received.
- **Stakeholder Buy-In**: By involving stakeholders in the review process, the team can ensure that the product is moving in a direction that is aligned with the business goals and user needs.

The Sprint Review is a collaborative process that helps ensure the team is building the right product by allowing for regular inspection and adaptation. It is a key element of the empirical process control that Scrum is based on, providing transparency and opportunities for inspection and adaptation at regular intervals.
