# Sprint is 
a time-boxed period in the [Scrum](scrum.md) framework during which specific work has to be completed and made ready for review. It is the heart of [Scrum](scrum.md), as it encapsulates the idea of iterative and incremental development and delivery of value.

### Characteristics of a Sprint:

- **Fixed Duration**: Sprints are of consistent duration throughout a development effort. Common Sprint lengths are 1, 2, or 4 weeks, with 2 weeks being the most typical.
- **No Changes Allowed**: To ensure that the goals set at the beginning of the Sprint are met, Sprints are protected from scope changes. New requirements that arise during a Sprint are added to the Product Backlog and considered for future Sprints.
- **Potentially Shippable Product Increment**: At the end of each Sprint, the team should have completed a set of product backlog items that can be released to customers, although the decision to release may be deferred.

### Key Events During a Sprint:

- **Sprint Planning**: This meeting marks the start of the Sprint by laying out the work to be performed. The team selects items from the Product Backlog they can commit to completing by the end of the Sprint, and they create a plan for delivering those items.
- **Daily Scrum**: Also known as the daily stand-up, this is a short (15 minutes or less) meeting held every day of the Sprint, where team members synchronize their work and progress and report any impediments to the Scrum Master.
- **Sprint Review**: At the end of the Sprint, the team demonstrates the completed work to stakeholders and discusses what went well and what could be improved.
- **Sprint Retrospective**: The team reflects on the past Sprint, discussing what was successful, what problems they encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) resolved.

### The Goal of a Sprint:

The primary goal of a Sprint is to produce a "Done," useable, and potentially releasable product increment. "Done" means that the work meets the team's agreed-upon quality standards and is fully integrated, tested, and ready to be delivered to the customer if desired.

### Sprint Cancellation:

Though rare, a Sprint can be cancelled before the time-box is over. Only the [Product Owner](product-owner.md) has the authority to cancel the Sprint, usually due to a drastic change in business conditions making the Sprint's goal obsolete. All completed and "Done" Product Backlog Items are reviewed, and the incomplete ones are re-estimated and put back on the Product Backlog.

### Sprint Continuity:

At the end of a Sprint, a new Sprint begins immediately. There is no downtime between Sprints, ensuring a steady pace of development and continuous improvement. This rhythm is fundamental to Scrum and helps teams maintain a sustainable pace of work.

Sprints enable teams to break down complex projects into manageable chunks, allowing them to focus on high-value features and deliver them quickly and efficiently. This iterative process also facilitates regular feedback and continuous adaptation, which are key aspects of Agile development.
