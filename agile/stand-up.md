# Stand-up meeting
also known as a daily stand-up or daily scrum, is a short, time-boxed meeting that is a common practice in Agile software development methodologies, particularly Scrum. The purpose of the stand-up is to provide a quick update on the progress of the team and to identify any blockers or issues that need to be addressed.

Key characteristics of a stand-up meeting include:

1. **Frequency**: Stand-up meetings are typically held daily, often at the start of the workday.

2. **Duration**: They are intentionally kept short, usually around 15 minutes, to maintain focus and efficiency.

3. **Standing**: The idea behind standing up is to keep the meeting short and to-the-point, as people are less likely to prolong the meeting if they are standing.

4. **Focused Updates**: Each team member provides updates on what they have accomplished since the last stand-up, what they plan to work on next, and any impediments they are facing.

5. **Team Participation**: All team members are expected to attend and participate. It's not a status meeting for a manager but rather a collaboration meeting for the team.

6. **Location**: Stand-up meetings are usually held in the same location and at the same time each day to create a routine.

7. **Structure**: The meeting typically follows a set pattern where each team member answers three questions:
   - What did I accomplish yesterday?
   - What will I do today?
   - What obstacles are impeding my progress?

8. **Problem-Solving Postponed**: Detailed discussions and problem-solving are usually postponed until after the stand-up to avoid prolonging the meeting. Those conversations can happen right after the stand-up or be scheduled for a later time.

9. **Scrum Master or Facilitator**: In Scrum, the Scrum Master facilitates the meeting to ensure it stays on track and that any identified impediments are addressed.

Stand-up meetings are effective for keeping the team aligned, identifying blockers early, and fostering communication. They are a key part of the inspect-and-adapt cycle that is at the heart of Agile methodologies. When conducted effectively, stand-up meetings can enhance team collaboration and ensure that everyone is focused on the most important tasks that contribute to the team's progress toward its goals.
