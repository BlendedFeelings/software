# User Story Mapping 
is a collaborative practice that organizes [user stories](user-story.md) into a useful model for understanding the functionality of a system, identifying holes and omissions in your backlog, and effectively planning holistic releases that deliver value to users and business with each release.

The process of user story mapping involves the following steps:

1. **Frame the Journey**: Start by outlining the userâ€™s journey through the product. This is often done by creating a backbone of large user activities, which are the high-level tasks that users perform when interacting with the product.

2. **Break Down the Journey**: Each large user activity is then broken down into smaller, more detailed tasks. These are the steps the user must take to complete each activity.

3. **Map User Stories**: Underneath these tasks, you can begin to map specific user stories that relate to each step in the user's journey. These user stories are the small increments of value that you can deliver to help the user complete that step.

4. **Prioritize and Slice**: Once the user stories are mapped, you can prioritize them based on various factors such as business value, user value, or technical risk. You can then slice out a release strategy by selecting a horizontal slice of user stories across the user journey that provides a thin slice of valuable, usable, and testable functionality.

5. **Plan Releases**: Based on the prioritization and the release strategy, plan for incremental releases that deliver value to users and gather feedback. Each release should represent a coherent set of features that support specific user goals.

6. **Refine and Iterate**: As you gather feedback and learn more about user needs, you can add, remove, or reprioritize user stories in the map. This helps to keep the development effort aligned with the users' needs and the product goals.

User story mapping is a visual exercise and often involves using sticky notes on a wall or a digital tool that allows for collaborative editing. The visual nature of the map helps the team to see the big picture of the product and understand how each piece fits together. It also helps to identify gaps in the user experience and ensure that the development work focuses on delivering a complete and coherent experience to the user.

User story mapping was introduced by Jeff Patton and is widely used in Agile and UX (User Experience) communities as a way to keep the team focused on delivering value to users throughout the development process.
