# User Story 
is an informal, general explanation of a software feature written from the perspective of the end user or customer. In [Agile](agile-methodology.md) and [Scrum](scrum.md) methodologies, user stories are a primary method of expressing requirements and are intended to ensure that the end user's perspective is considered throughout the development process.

User stories are a simple way of documenting the desired outcome without detailing how that outcome is achieved. They focus on the value or result that the user will receive, rather than the specific technical implementation.

A user story typically follows a simple template:

**As a [type of user], I want [an action] so that [a benefit/value].**

Here's an example:

**As a website visitor, I want to be able to create an account so that I can save my preferences and access member-only features.**

### Components of a User Story

- **Title**: A brief, descriptive title for the user story to quickly convey what the story is about.
- **Role (Who)**: The type of user or role who will benefit from the feature.
- **Goal/Desire (What)**: The feature or goal that the user is trying to achieve.
- **Benefit/Value (Why)**: The reason the user wants this feature; the value it provides to them.

### User Story Characteristics

User stories are often remembered by the acronym INVEST, which says that good stories are:

- **Independent**: They can be developed in any sequence and changes to one story don't affect the others.
- **Negotiable**: They are not a detailed contract and should leave space for discussion.
- **Valuable**: They deliver a chunk of functionality that is of value to the users or customers.
- **Estimable**: They are clear enough that developers can estimate how much effort will be required to build them.
- **Small**: They should be small enough to plan and build relatively quickly.
- **Testable**: There must be a way to determine if the story is completed and works as intended.

### Accompanying Artifacts

User stories are often accompanied by additional artifacts that provide more detail:

- **Acceptance Criteria**: Specific conditions that must be met for the story to be considered complete.
- **User Story Mapping**: A visual representation that organizes user stories into a useful model for understanding the functionality of a system, identifying holes and omissions, and effectively planning holistic releases that deliver value to users and business with each release.
- **Epics**: Large user stories that are too big to be completed in a single iteration and need to be broken down into smaller stories.

User stories are a key part of the Agile framework, helping to keep the focus on user needs at every step of the development process. They encourage participation and discussion among team members and stakeholders, and they ensure that the functionality developed is aligned with what the user actually wants and needs.

Certainly! Below are a few examples of user stories across different types of projects. Each user story is written from the perspective of a specific user role and includes a goal and a reason for that goal.

### Examples

#### E-Commerce Website

**Title**: User Account Creation

**As a** shopper,  
**I want** to be able to create a personal account on the e-commerce website,  
**So that** I can save my shipping information and order history for future purchases.

#### Mobile Health App

**Title**: Daily Activity Tracking

**As a** fitness enthusiast,  
**I want** to track my daily activities and workouts in the app,  
**So that** I can analyze my progress and plan my fitness goals accordingly.

#### Online Learning Platform

**Title**: Course Recommendation System

**As a** student,  
**I want** to receive course recommendations based on my learning history and preferences,  
**So that** I can find new courses that align with my interests and educational goals.

#### Customer Relationship Management (CRM) System

**Title**: Lead Prioritization

**As a** sales representative,  
**I want** the CRM system to automatically prioritize leads based on engagement and potential value,  
**So that** I can focus my efforts on the leads most likely to convert.

#### Project Management Tool

**Title**: Task Dependencies

**As a** project manager,  
**I want** to define dependencies between tasks,  
**So that** the team can understand the order in which tasks need to be completed.

#### Social Media Platform

**Title**: Privacy Settings Customization

**As a** user,  
**I want** to customize my privacy settings,  
**So that** I can control who sees my posts and personal information.

#### Banking Application

**Title**: Mobile Check Deposit

**As a** bank customer,  
**I want** to deposit checks using my smartphone's camera,  
**So that** I don't have to visit a bank branch or ATM for check deposits.

#### Travel Booking Website

**Title**: Multi-City Flight Search

**As a** traveler,  
**I want** to search for multi-city flight itineraries,  
**So that** I can plan complex trips with multiple destinations easily.

These examples illustrate how user stories capture the essence of what the user needs and why, without getting into the details of how the feature will be implemented. This allows the development team to collaborate and come up with the best possible solution to meet the user's needs.
