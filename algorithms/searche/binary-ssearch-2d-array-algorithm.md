# BinarySearch2dArray
is a search algorithm that is used to find a specific value in a two-dimensional array. This algorithm works by dividing the array into smaller sub-arrays and comparing the target value with the middle element of each sub-array. If the target value is less than the middle element, the search continues in the left half of the sub-array. If the target value is greater than the middle element, the search continues in the right half of the sub-array. This process is repeated until the target value is found or the search has exhausted all possible sub-arrays.
