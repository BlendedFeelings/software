# Breadth-first search (BFS)
is an algorithm used for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbours. In other words, it visits all the vertices at the same level before moving on to the vertices at the next level.
