# Depth-first search (DFS)
is a common algorithm used in software development for traversing or searching through a tree or graph data structure.

The algorithm starts at the root node (or any arbitrary node) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. This means that it goes as deep as possible in each branch before exploring other branches.
