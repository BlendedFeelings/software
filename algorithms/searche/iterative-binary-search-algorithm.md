# IterativeBinarySearch
is a searching algorithm that is used to search for a specific element in a sorted array or list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half until the target element is found or the search interval is empty.

The iterative implementation of binary search is similar to the recursive implementation, but instead of making recursive calls to search the left or right half of the array, it uses a loop to repeatedly update the search interval.
