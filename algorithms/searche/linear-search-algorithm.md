# Linear search 
is a simple search algorithm that sequentially checks each element in a collection until a match is found or the entire collection has been searched. It works by comparing each element of the collection with the target value until a match is found or the end of the collection is reached. If the target value is found, the search terminates and returns the index of the matching element. If the target value is not found, the search returns a special value such as -1 to indicate that the target is not in the collection
