# Bead Sort 
is a sorting algorithm that is based on the natural phenomenon of gravity acting on objects. It works by simulating a set of beads that are arranged on a set of rods, with each bead representing a number to be sorted. The beads are then allowed to fall under gravity, and as they fall, they move into their correct positions, sorting the numbers in the process. This algorithm is interesting because it is a natural algorithm that does not rely on comparisons between numbers, making it potentially faster than other comparison-based sorting algorithms. However, it is not practical for large sets of data and is mainly used as a theoretical exercise.
