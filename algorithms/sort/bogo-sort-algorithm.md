# Bogo Sort
is a highly inefficient sorting algorithm that works by shuffling a list randomly until it happens to be sorted. It is not a practical sorting algorithm and is used mostly for educational purposes to demonstrate how not to sort a list. The algorithm has an average-case time complexity of O(n * n!) and a worst-case time complexity of O(âˆž).
