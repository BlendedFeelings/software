# Cocktail Shaker Sort 
(also known as bidirectional bubble sort), is a variation of the bubble sort algorithm. It is a sorting algorithm that sorts a list by iterating over the list in both directions, from the beginning to the end and from the end to the beginning. The algorithm works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm terminates when no more swaps are needed. The name "cocktail shaker sort" comes from the way the algorithm works, as it is similar to the way a bartender shakes a cocktail shaker.
