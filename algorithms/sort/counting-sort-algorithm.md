# Counting Sort
is an algorithm used to sort a collection of integers in linear time. It works by counting the number of occurrences of each integer in the input collection, and then using this information to construct a sorted output array. The algorithm assumes that the input integers are non-negative, and that the range of possible values is known in advance. Counting Sort is often used as a subroutine in more complex sorting algorithms, such as Radix Sort.
