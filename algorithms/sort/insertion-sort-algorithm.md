# Insertion Sort
is a simple sorting algorithm that works by taking one element from the input array and inserting it in its correct position in a new sorted array. The algorithm iterates through the input array, comparing each element to the elements in the sorted array until it finds the correct position to insert the element. This process is repeated until all elements have been inserted into the sorted array. Insertion Sort has a time complexity of O(n^2) in the worst case, but it is efficient for small inputs or nearly sorted arrays.
