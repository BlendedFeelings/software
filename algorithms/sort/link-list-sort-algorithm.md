# Linked List Sort
is not a built-in function in most programming languages, but it is possible to implement it using a linked list data structure. A linked list is a collection of nodes where each node contains a value and a reference (or pointer) to the next node in the list.

To sort a linked list, we can use a sorting algorithm such as Merge Sort or Quick Sort. These algorithms work by recursively dividing the list into smaller sub-lists, sorting those sub-lists, and then merging them back together in the correct order.
