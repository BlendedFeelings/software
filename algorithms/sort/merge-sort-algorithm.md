# Merge Sort
is a popular sorting algorithm that follows the divide and conquer paradigm. It works by dividing the unsorted list into n sub-lists, each containing one element, and then repeatedly merging sub-lists to produce new sorted sub-lists until there is only one sub-list remaining. The algorithm is efficient, with a time complexity of O(n log n), and is often used in sorting large data sets.
