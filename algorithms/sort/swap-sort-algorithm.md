# SwapSort
is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The algorithm iterates through the list of elements, comparing adjacent elements and swapping them if they are in the wrong order. This process is repeated until the list is sorted.
