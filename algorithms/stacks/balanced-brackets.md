# Balanced brackets
is a problem in computer science that involves checking whether a given string of brackets is balanced or not. A string is considered balanced if it contains only brackets of the same type and if the opening brackets are in the correct order and number to match the closing brackets. For example, the string "([])" is balanced, while the string "([)]" is not balanced. This problem is often used as an exercise in programming interviews and can be solved using a stack data structure.
