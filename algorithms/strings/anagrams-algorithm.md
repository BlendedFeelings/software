# Anagram algorithm
checks if two strings are anagram of each other. Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase. For example, the word "listen" is an anagram of the word "silent". Anagrams can be formed by rearranging all the letters of the original word or phrase, or by using only some of the letters. Anagrams are often used in word games and puzzles.
