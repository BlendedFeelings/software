# Valid Parentheses
given a string s containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine
if the input string is valid. 
An input string is valid if: 
- Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets must be closed in the correct order. 
- Every close bracket has a corresponding open bracket of the same type.
