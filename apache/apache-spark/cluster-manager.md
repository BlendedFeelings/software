# Cluster Manager in Apache Spark
is responsible for managing the resources of a cluster and allocating them to various Spark applications. There are several types of cluster managers that Spark can run on, each with its own set of features and capabilities. Here are the main types of cluster managers supported by Spark:

1. **Standalone Cluster Manager**:
   - The simplest cluster manager included with Spark that is easy to set up and use.
   - It's a basic but robust manager to get started with Spark, especially for development and testing.
   - It offers a simple web UI for monitoring and can run Spark applications in a distributed manner.

2. **Apache Hadoop YARN**:
   - YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is a resource manager introduced in Hadoop 2.0.
   - It allows Spark to run on top of Hadoop alongside other data processing frameworks.
   - YARN can dynamically allocate resources to applications as needed, which is useful for multi-tenant environments.
   - It integrates well with Hadoopâ€™s storage system, HDFS, and other Hadoop ecosystem components.

3. **Apache Mesos**:
   - A general-purpose cluster manager that can also run Hadoop MapReduce and service applications.
   - Mesos is known for its fine-grained resource sharing capabilities, allowing for dynamic partitioning of the cluster resources between applications.
   - It provides efficient resource isolation and sharing across distributed applications or frameworks.

4. **Kubernetes**:
   - An open-source system for automating deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.
   - Spark on Kubernetes is an active area of development and allows Spark to be run on clusters managed by Kubernetes.
   - It supports dynamic allocation of resources and allows for deploying Spark within a containerized infrastructure.

5. **Amazon EC2** (Not a cluster manager itself):
   - While not a cluster manager, Spark can also be easily deployed on Amazon EC2 instances using the provided scripts in the Spark distribution.
   - This method is often used for setting up standalone Spark clusters on cloud infrastructure.

The choice of cluster manager depends on the specific requirements of the environment and the application, such as integration with existing systems, resource management needs, and ease of use.

Regardless of the cluster manager used, the general responsibilities include:

- **Resource Allocation**: Deciding how many and which nodes (or containers) are granted to a Spark application.
- **Executor Management**: Starting and stopping Spark executor processes based on the demands of the Spark application.
- **Fault Tolerance**: Handling failures of executor nodes and reallocating resources as necessary.
- **Monitoring**: Providing information about the state of the cluster resources and running applications.

When a Spark application is submitted, the Spark driver program communicates with the cluster manager to negotiate resources and launch executors. The cluster manager then maintains the resources and scheduling for the application as it runs.
