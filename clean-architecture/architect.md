# Architect Uncle 
is someone that continues to be a programmer. They may not write as much code but they continue to engage in programming tasks. They do this because they cannot do their jobs if they are not experiencing the problems that they are creating for the rest of the programmer.

According to Uncle Bob, a software architect should:

1. **Stay in Touch with Code**: Architects should continue to engage with code, even if they are not writing as much of it as they once did. This helps them stay aware of the challenges and issues that developers face on a daily basis.

2. **Understand the Impact of Decisions**: By being involved in programming tasks, architects can better understand the consequences of their architectural choices. This hands-on experience allows them to make more informed decisions that consider the ease or difficulty of implementation.

3. **Communicate with Developers**: An architect who codes can communicate more effectively with the development team, speaking the same language and understanding the technical details. This fosters better collaboration and helps in articulating technical vision and guidelines.

4. **Lead by Example**: When architects are involved in coding, they can lead by example and demonstrate best practices. They can also directly contribute to critical parts of the system, ensuring that the architecture is properly implemented.

5. **Stay Current**: Technology changes rapidly, and by continuing to code, architects can stay up-to-date with new tools, languages, and frameworks. This knowledge is essential for making architectural decisions that will not become obsolete quickly.

6. **Empathy for Developers**: By facing the same challenges as the rest of the programming team, architects develop empathy for the developers. This can lead to more developer-friendly designs and a better working environment.

Uncle Bob's perspective on architecture is that it should be a role deeply integrated with the development process, rather than a separate, higher-level position that is disconnected from the day-to-day realities of coding. This approach aims to bridge the gap between high-level design and practical implementation, ensuring that the architecture serves the needs of both the system and the developers building it.
