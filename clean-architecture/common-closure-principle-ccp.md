# Common Closure Principle (CCP) 
states that classes that change for the same reasons and at the same times should be grouped together in the same package (or module). This means that if one class in a package changes, it is likely that other classes in the same package will also need to change. Grouping these classes together helps to minimize the maintenance effort, as changes to one part of the codebase are less likely to impact other parts.

The CCP is closely related to the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP) which states that a class should have only one reason to change. While SRP is about individual classes, CCP is about the organization of classes into packages.

By applying the CCP, you can:

1. **Reduce the Impact of Change**: If a change is made in one part of the system, it should not necessitate changes in unrelated parts of the system.

2. **Ease of Understanding**: Developers can better understand the structure of the system if related classes that change together are located near each other.

3. **Reusability**: It becomes easier to reuse packages because all the functionality within a package is related and changes together, making it less likely that changes will be needed if the package is reused in a different context.

4. **Release Management**: It simplifies versioning and releasing of the software, as related changes are localized to specific packages.

The CCP complements other design principles and patterns by emphasizing the importance of how classes are grouped together, which in turn affects the maintainability and adaptability of the software system. It is an important consideration in clean architecture, where the goal is to produce a system that is modular, scalable, and manageable over time.
