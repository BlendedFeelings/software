The Common Reuse Principle (CRP) 
suggests that classes that are grouped into a package or module should have a high degree of cohesion. They should be related by function and should be used together. If a package contains classes that are not tightly related, it violates CRP because clients that need to use one class might be forced to depend on others that they do not use, which can lead to unnecessary coupling.

> "The classes in a package should be reused together. If you reuse one of the classes in a package, you reuse them all."

In the context of Clean Architecture, CRP can be applied as follows:

1. **Component Cohesion**: Components should be designed so that classes within a component are closely related and tend to change for the same reasons. This means that when a change is made to one class, it is likely that the other classes in the component will also need to be changed, which is a sign of good cohesion.

2. **Minimize Dependencies**: By adhering to CRP, you can minimize dependencies between components. If components are well-crafted with only closely related classes, then depending on one component will not bring in a lot of unnecessary code from unrelated classes.

3. **Release and Versioning**: CRP helps with component release and versioning. If classes are used together, they can be released together. This simplifies the release process and dependency management.

4. **Encapsulation**: CRP encourages encapsulation. By grouping related classes together, you can hide the internal implementation details and expose only the necessary interfaces to the users of the package.

5. **Refactoring**: CRP can make refactoring easier. When classes are highly cohesive, changes tend to be localized within a component, reducing the impact on the rest of the system.

6. **Interchangeability**: In Clean Architecture, the use of interfaces and the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) allows for components to be easily interchangeable. CRP complements this by ensuring that the components themselves are cohesive and can be swapped out without bringing along unrelated dependencies.

In summary, the Common Reuse Principle helps to create a clean separation of concerns within a system, which is a fundamental goal of Clean Architecture. By grouping related classes that are likely to be reused together into components, the system becomes easier to maintain, extend, and refactor, leading to a more robust and flexible architecture.
