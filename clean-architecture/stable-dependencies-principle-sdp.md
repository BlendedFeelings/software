# Stable Dependencies Principle (SDP) 
means that in a well-designed system, a given software component should depend only on components that are more stable than itself. Stability, in this context, refers to the likelihood of a component to undergo change. A stable component is one that is less likely to change, while an unstable component is more likely to change.

> "Dependencies should be in the direction of stability."

Here's why the Stable Dependencies Principle is important:

1. **Minimize Impact of Changes**: By depending on stable components, the impact of changes is minimized. If a component depends on something that changes frequently, it will also need to be changed frequently, which increases maintenance costs and the risk of introducing bugs.

2. **Predictability**: Stable dependencies make the system more predictable. When changes are required, they can be made with confidence that they will not have unexpected side effects on other parts of the system.

3. **Reusability**: Components that depend on stable interfaces or components are more reusable since they are less likely to be affected by changes in other parts of the system.

4. **Ease of Understanding**: A system that follows the SDP is easier to understand because the flow of control and data aligns with the dependency graph, which reflects stability.

In practical terms, to adhere to the Stable Dependencies Principle, you should:

- **Identify and Isolate Stable Components**: Identify the components that are less likely to change over time, such as core business rules or widely used utility classes. These components should be isolated from less stable elements, like UI or frameworks, which tend to change more often.

- **Use Abstractions**: Depend on abstractions rather than concrete implementations. Abstractions are less likely to change than their implementations. This is where the Stable Abstractions Principle (SAP) comes into play, which states that the more stable a component is, the more abstract it should be.

- **Invert Dependencies**: Use the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) to invert dependencies so that high-level modules, which are often more stable, do not depend on low-level modules, which are often less stable. Instead, both should depend on abstractions.

- **Manage Transitive Dependencies**: Be mindful of transitive dependencies, where a change in one component can affect another component indirectly through a chain of dependencies.

By following the Stable Dependencies Principle, developers can create systems that are more resilient to change, easier to maintain, and more scalable over time.
