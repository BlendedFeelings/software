# Code Smell
is a set of common coding practices that indicate potential problems or issues in the code. These issues can include poor design, inefficient algorithms, and other factors that can lead to errors, bugs, or maintenance problems down the road. 

Examples:

1. Long Method: A method that is too long and complex, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

2. Large Class: A class that has too many responsibilities and/or methods, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

3. Duplicate Code: Code that is repeated in multiple places, making it difficult to maintain and update.

4. Magic Number: A numeric value that appears in code without any explanation or context, making it difficult to understand and maintain.

5. Primitive Obsession: Overuse of primitive data types (such as integers and strings) instead of creating custom objects, leading to less readable and maintainable code.

6. Switch Statements: Overuse of switch statements, leading to less readable and maintainable code.

7. Data Clumps: Groups of data that are always used together, but are not encapsulated in a separate class or object.

8. Call Super: A subclass that overrides a method of its superclass, but fails to call the overridden method in the superclass, leading to unexpected behavior and bugs.

9. Comments: Overuse of comments to explain code that is difficult to understand, instead of writing more readable and maintainable code.

10. Dead Code: Code that is no longer used or executed, but remains in the codebase, leading to unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead.
