# DAMA-DMBOK
or Data Management Body of Knowledge, 
is a framework and guide for data management professionals, providing a standard industry view of data management functions, terminology, and best practices, without detailing specific methods or techniques.

DAMA International, the Data Management Association International, is a global association of technical and business professionals that champions the concepts of information and data management. They are responsible for the DAMA-DMBOK guide.
