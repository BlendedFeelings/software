# Data wrangling 
also known as data munging, is the process of transforming and mapping data from one "raw" data form into another format with the intent of making it more appropriate and valuable for a variety of downstream purposes, such as analytics. This process is a fundamental step in the data preparation stage and involves a variety of tasks, including:

1. **Data Cleaning**: Removing inaccuracies and correcting the data where necessary.
2. **Data Structuring**: Converting data from one format or structure to another.
3. **Data Enriching**: Augmenting the data with new fields or data from additional sources.
4. **Data Validating**: Ensuring the data conforms to certain quality standards or norms.
5. **Data Aggregating**: Summarizing or grouping data in a structured form.
6. **Data Sorting**: Arranging data in a certain order for analysis or presentation.

Tools and programming languages like Python (Pandas, NumPy), R, SQL, and specialized data transformation software are commonly used for data wrangling tasks.
