# Materialized View pattern 
is a software architecture pattern that is used to improve the performance of applications by providing faster read access to data at the cost of some additional complexity in the system. This pattern is particularly useful when dealing with large volumes of data and complex queries that are computationally expensive and slow to execute.

Here's how the Materialized View pattern works:

1. **Data Source**: The pattern starts with a data source, which is typically a database or a set of databases that contain the raw data.

2. **Complex Queries**: Applications often need to perform complex queries on this data, such as aggregations, joins, or calculations that span multiple tables or databases.

3. **Performance Issues**: These complex queries can be slow and resource-intensive, leading to poor performance, especially when the data set is large or when the system needs to support a high number of concurrent users.

4. **Materialized View**: To address this, a materialized view is created. This is a precomputed data set that contains the results of the complex query. It's like a snapshot of the query result that is stored for quick access.

5. **Data Refresh**: The materialized view is not dynamically updated with each change to the underlying data. Instead, it is refreshed on a schedule or triggered by specific events. This means that the data in the materialized view can be stale, and the frequency of refreshes needs to be balanced against the need for up-to-date data.

6. **Read Access**: When an application needs to perform a read operation that would normally require a complex query, it can instead quickly retrieve the data from the materialized view.

7. **Performance Improvement**: Since the data is precomputed and stored in a format that is optimized for read access, the performance of read operations is significantly improved.

8. **Write Complexity**: However, this comes at the cost of additional complexity in managing writes. Any write operation that affects data in the materialized view requires that the view be updated or refreshed to reflect the new state.

9. **Consistency**: Depending on the system requirements, different strategies can be used to maintain consistency between the materialized views and the underlying data sources. This could be eventual consistency, where the materialized view is updated after a certain delay, or immediate consistency, where the view is updated as part of the transaction that changes the data.

The Materialized View pattern is commonly used in scenarios where read performance is critical, and the data does not need to be up-to-the-second current. Examples include data warehousing, reporting systems, and applications that display aggregated or summary information.

It's important to note that materialized views can be implemented at the database level (supported by many RDBMS systems) or at the application level, where the application itself manages the creation, storage, and refreshing of the views.
