# Read your write
is a consistency model that ensures that once a write operation has been performed by a particular process or user, any subsequent read operations by that same process or user will reflect that write. In other words, a system with "read your write" consistency guarantees that a user will always see their own changes.

This type of consistency is particularly important in user-facing applications where users expect to see the results of their actions immediately. For example, after posting a message on a social media platform, users expect to see their post appear in their feed right away.

"Read your write" consistency is a specific case of session consistency, which is broader and ensures that a system respects the sequence of operations within the context of a single session.

Here's how "read your write" consistency can be achieved:

1. **Client-side tracking**: The client keeps track of the writes it has made and ensures that it reads from a data source that includes those writes.

2. **Sticky sessions**: The system directs all reads and writes for a particular user to the same server or set of servers where recent writes are known to have occurred.

3. **Read-after-write consistency**: This is a specific guarantee that after a new value is written, any subsequent read will return that value. This can be implemented by ensuring that the read operation accesses the same data replica that was updated or by using data versioning.

4. **Synchronous replication**: In a distributed system, synchronous replication can be used to ensure that all replicas are updated before the write is acknowledged to the client.

"Read your write" consistency is less strict than linearizability or strict consistency but is often sufficient for many practical applications. It strikes a balance between user experience and system performance, allowing for some degree of replication lag or eventual consistency in other aspects of the system, while still providing a consistent view to the user based on their actions.
