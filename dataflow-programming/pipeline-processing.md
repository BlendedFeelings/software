# Pipeline processing 
refers to a design pattern where data passes through a sequence of processing stages (or nodes) in a linear fashion. Each stage in the pipeline performs a specific operation on the data, transforming it step by step until the final result is produced. This pattern is particularly well-suited for stream processing and parallel computing because different stages of the pipeline can often operate concurrently.

Here's how pipeline processing typically works in dataflow programming:

1. **Linear Sequence of Stages**: The pipeline is composed of a series of processing nodes or stages arranged in a linear sequence. Each node is responsible for a specific operation, such as filtering, mapping, or reducing data.

2. **Data Tokens**: Data is encapsulated in tokens that flow through the pipeline. A token can be a simple data item, a collection, or a more complex data structure.

3. **Processing Nodes**: Each node in the pipeline receives data tokens from its predecessor, processes them, and sends the results to the next node in the sequence. Nodes can be simple functions or more complex entities with internal state.

4. **Concurrency**: Nodes can potentially process multiple tokens simultaneously. If one node is slow or involves a time-consuming operation, it may not block subsequent nodes from processing other tokens. This allows for parallel execution and can improve the overall throughput of the system.

5. **Synchronization**: Depending on the design, there may be synchronization mechanisms to ensure that data tokens are processed in order or to manage dependencies between tokens.

6. **Buffering**: Nodes may have buffers to hold incoming tokens if they are not ready to be processed immediately. This can help to smooth out any irregularities in the data flow and can also support backpressure management.

7. **Termination**: The last node in the pipeline produces the final output. This could be a collection of results, a single value, or a side effect such as writing to a database or file system.

8. **Fault Tolerance**: The pipeline may include mechanisms for error handling and recovery, allowing it to gracefully handle failures in individual nodes without crashing the entire system.

Pipeline processing is a powerful concept in dataflow programming because it allows for the decomposition of complex processing tasks into simpler, reusable components. Each component can be developed, tested, and optimized independently. The pipeline model also maps well to distributed systems, where different stages can be executed on different machines or cores.

In practice, dataflow programming and pipeline processing are implemented in various programming models and frameworks, such as Apache Beam, which provides an abstraction for building parallel data processing pipelines, or in languages like Elixir, which uses the concept of processes and message passing for building concurrent applications.
