# Architecture Decision Record (ADR) 
is a document that captures an important architectural decision made along with its context and consequences. It is a way to track the architectural history of a project and provide a record of why certain decisions were made. The ADR helps with understanding the thought process behind the architecture of a software system and can be useful for new team members, for future maintenance, and for potential architectural refactoring.

An ADR typically includes the following sections:

1. **Title**: A descriptive name for the ADR.
2. **Status**: The current status of the decision (e.g., proposed, accepted, deprecated, superseded, etc.).
3. **Context**: The circumstances that led to the decision being made. This includes the problem or issue that the architecture decision is addressing.
4. **Decision**: A clear statement of what the decision is, including any alternatives that were considered and rejected.
5. **Consequences**: The impact of the decision, including benefits, drawbacks, and other implications. This can also include how the decision addresses the problem stated in the context.
6. **Assumptions**: Any assumptions that are being made when the decision was taken.
7. **Considerations**: Factors that were considered as part of the decision-making process, such as requirements, constraints, and trade-offs.
8. **Implications**: How the decision might affect various aspects of the system, such as maintainability, scalability, performance, security, etc.
9. **Related Decisions**: Links to other ADRs that are related to this decision.
10. **References**: Any external references that provide additional context or information related to the decision.

Here is an example of what an ADR might look like:

# ADR 1: Use Microservice Architecture for Order Processing System

## Status
Accepted

## Context
Our monolithic application has become too complex to deploy and scale effectively. Development speed has slowed down due to the large codebase and intertwined components.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt a microservice architecture for our order processing system. This will allow us to develop, deploy, and scale each service independently.

## Consequences
- **Pros:**
  - Independent deployment and scaling
  - Easier to understand and maintain smaller codebases
  - Flexibility to use different technologies for different services
- **Cons:**
  - Increased complexity in managing multiple services
  - Need for careful design of service boundaries
  - Potential for increased latency due to network communication between services

## Assumptions
- Our team has the skills to develop and manage a microservice-based system.
- The additional infrastructure required for microservices will be available.

## Considerations
- The current monolithic architecture is not meeting our needs for agility and scalability.
- Microservices can potentially improve our deployment frequency and
