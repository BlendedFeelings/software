# External Configuration Store pattern 
is a software architecture pattern that involves decoupling configuration settings from the application code. This allows for the application's configuration to be managed and accessed from a central location, which can be particularly useful for applications that are deployed across multiple environments (development, testing, production, etc.).

Here are the key aspects of the External Configuration Store pattern:

1. **Separation of Concerns**: By keeping configuration separate from the code, developers can focus on application development without worrying about environment-specific configurations. This separation also makes the codebase cleaner and easier to manage.

2. **Centralized Management**: Configuration settings are stored in a central location, which can be a dedicated configuration service, a database, or cloud-based key-value stores like AWS Parameter Store, Azure App Configuration, or HashiCorp Vault. This centralization simplifies the management of configuration settings, especially for distributed systems.

3. **Dynamic Configuration**: The application can dynamically read configuration settings at runtime, which means changes to the configuration can be made without redeploying the application. This supports dynamic and flexible application behavior based on the configuration.

4. **Environment Agnosticism**: The application can be deployed in different environments without changes to the codebase. Configuration settings specific to each environment are managed externally and loaded at runtime.

5. **Security**: Sensitive information such as passwords, API keys, and connection strings can be securely stored and managed. Access to the configuration store can be controlled and audited.

6. **Versioning and Auditing**: The external configuration store can maintain a history of configuration changes, which aids in auditing and tracking changes over time. This can also help in rolling back to previous configurations if necessary.

7. **Ease of Scaling**: As new instances of the application are deployed, they can automatically fetch their configuration from the external store, which simplifies scaling up or down.

To implement the External Configuration Store pattern, you typically need to:

- Identify the configuration settings that can vary between environments or deployments.
- Choose an appropriate storage mechanism for the configuration data.
- Implement a mechanism in the application to fetch and possibly cache the configuration settings from the external store.
- Secure access to the configuration store, ensuring that only authorized applications and users can read or modify the settings.

The External Configuration Store pattern is particularly relevant for cloud-native applications and microservices architectures, where services may be deployed and scaled dynamically and need to adapt to different environments without code changes.
