# Gatekeeper pattern 
in software architecture is a design pattern that controls access to a particular resource or object. The main idea behind this pattern is to protect the integrity of the resource by ensuring that only valid, authorized, or well-formed requests are allowed to interact with it. This pattern is often used to enforce security, validate input, or manage access rights.

Here's how the Gatekeeper pattern typically works:

1. **Request**: A client makes a request to access or perform an operation on a resource.

2. **Gatekeeper**: Before the request reaches the actual resource, it must pass through a "gatekeeper". This gatekeeper is a component or layer whose sole responsibility is to validate the request.

3. **Validation**: The gatekeeper checks the request for various criteria, such as:
    - Authentication: Verifying the identity of the requester.
    - Authorization: Ensuring the requester has permission to access the resource or perform the operation.
    - Input Validation: Checking that the data provided in the request is in the correct format and within acceptable ranges.

4. **Forwarding**: If the request passes all the checks, the gatekeeper forwards it to the resource.

5. **Resource Access**: The resource processes the request and performs the required operation, whether it's data retrieval, modification, or some other action.

6. **Response**: The resource sends a response back to the client, which may pass through the gatekeeper again for additional processing (e.g., filtering sensitive information) before reaching the client.

The Gatekeeper pattern is useful in scenarios where you want to:
- Centralize request validation logic.
- Keep the resource or service code clean and focused on business logic rather than security or validation concerns.
- Make the system more secure by preventing invalid or unauthorized access to resources.
- Simplify maintenance and updates to validation logic, as it's contained in a single place.

Implementing a Gatekeeper can be as simple as an if-statement checking user credentials, or as complex as a full-blown API Gateway handling thousands of requests per second with detailed rules and policies.

It's important to note that the Gatekeeper pattern can introduce a single point of failure in the system. If the gatekeeper becomes unavailable or is compromised, it can affect the entire system's accessibility or security. Therefore, it's crucial to implement proper error handling, monitoring, and redundancy for the gatekeeper component.
