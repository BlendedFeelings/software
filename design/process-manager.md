# Process manager 
is a system or tool that oversees the execution of processes within an operating system or application. It is responsible for managing the lifecycle of processes, including their creation, execution, and termination. The role of a process manager can vary depending on the context, but it generally includes several key responsibilities:

1. **Process Scheduling**: The process manager is responsible for scheduling processes to run on the system's CPU(s). It determines the order in which processes are executed based on scheduling algorithms and priorities.

2. **Resource Allocation**: It allocates system resources, such as memory, CPU time, and input/output devices, to processes. The process manager ensures that each process has the necessary resources to run efficiently.

3. **Process Creation and Termination**: The process manager handles the creation of new processes through system calls and the termination of existing processes, either normally or through forced termination in case of errors or unresponsiveness.

4. **Process Monitoring**: It monitors the state of running processes, checking for issues such as deadlocks, resource starvation, or excessive resource consumption. It may provide tools to diagnose and troubleshoot process-related issues.

5. **Concurrency Management**: The process manager manages concurrent execution of multiple processes, ensuring that they do not interfere with each other and that shared resources are accessed in a controlled manner.

6. **Security and Isolation**: It enforces security policies and maintains isolation between processes to prevent them from affecting each other's operation or accessing restricted data.

7. **Communication and Synchronization**: The process manager provides mechanisms for inter-process communication (IPC) and synchronization, allowing processes to coordinate their activities and share data safely.

8. **State Persistence**: In some systems, the process manager may handle the persistence of process state, allowing processes to be paused and resumed, or moved between different machines in a distributed system.

Process managers are commonly found in operating systems, where they are a fundamental part of the kernel, managing the execution of all user and system processes. In the context of software applications, a process manager may refer to a component or library that manages background tasks, worker processes, or microservices within the application.

Examples of process managers include the Windows Task Manager, the UNIX/Linux `init` and `systemd` systems, and application-specific process managers like PM2 for Node.js applications. These tools offer various features to developers and system administrators, such as starting and stopping services, viewing logs, and automatically restarting failed processes.
