# Quarantine pattern
is a software design pattern that is used to handle situations where code or data may be untrusted or potentially harmful. It is commonly used in situations where systems interact with external components, user-generated content, or any input that could potentially contain malicious content, such as viruses, worms, or other security threats.

The main idea behind the Quarantine pattern is to isolate such untrusted components in a restricted environment where they can be executed or analyzed without risking the integrity of the main system. This isolation helps prevent any potential negative impact on the system's security, stability, and data integrity.

Here are some key aspects of the Quarantine pattern:

1. **Isolation**: The potentially harmful code or data is executed or stored in an isolated environment that has limited access to the rest of the system's resources.

2. **Analysis**: The quarantined content can be checked and analyzed for malicious behavior or vulnerabilities. This can be done through automated scanning tools, manual code reviews, or other security checks.

3. **Sanitization**: If the content is found to be harmless, it can be sanitized or cleaned before being integrated into the main system. This might involve removing any potentially dangerous parts or converting it into a safer format.

4. **Monitoring**: The quarantined environment is closely monitored to detect any unusual or malicious activity. This monitoring helps to identify threats early and respond to them quickly.

5. **Limited Privileges**: The quarantined environment operates with the least amount of privileges necessary to perform its tasks, reducing the potential damage in case of a security breach.

6. **Time Constraints**: Sometimes, the quarantine is also time-based, meaning that the content is held in the isolated environment for a specific period before being released or rejected.

An example of the Quarantine pattern in action could be an email system that receives attachments. Instead of directly allowing users to download and open attachments, the system could first move the attachments to a quarantine area where they are scanned for viruses and malware. Only after ensuring that the attachments are safe, the system would allow them to be accessed by the users.

Implementing the Quarantine pattern requires careful consideration of the system's architecture and the potential risks involved with the untrusted content. It is an important pattern for enhancing the security and robustness of software systems, especially those that are exposed to external inputs or operate in potentially insecure environments.
