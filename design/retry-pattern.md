# Retry pattern 
is a software architectural pattern that enables an application to transparently handle temporary failures when it tries to connect to a service or network resource by automatically retrying the failed operation. This is particularly useful when dealing with transient conditions like temporary network connectivity issues or service unavailability, which might be resolved after a short period of time.

Here's how the retry pattern typically works:

1. **Initial Request:** The application makes a request to a service or resource.
2. **Failure Detection:** If the request fails, the application detects the failure.
3. **Retry Logic:** The application waits for a predefined period of time (retry interval) before making another attempt to perform the operation.
4. **Repeat Attempts:** Steps 2 and 3 are repeated a certain number of times (retry count) or until a successful response is received.
5. **Exponential Backoff:** To avoid overwhelming the service or resource, the time between retries can increase exponentially with each attempt. This is known as exponential backoff.
6. **Circuit Breaker:** To prevent the system from trying indefinitely, a circuit breaker can be used to stop retries after a certain number of attempts or a certain period of time.
7. **Fallback:** If the operation continues to fail after all retries have been exhausted, the application can execute a fallback action, such as using a cached response or returning an error message to the user.

Implementing the retry pattern requires careful consideration of several factors:

- **Retry Count:** The maximum number of retry attempts before giving up.
- **Retry Interval:** The time to wait between retry attempts.
- **Jitter:** Adding randomness to the retry interval to avoid synchronized retries in distributed systems.
- **Retryable Failures:** Identifying which types of failures are transient and suitable for retries.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Keeping track of retry attempts and failures for analysis and improvement of the system.
