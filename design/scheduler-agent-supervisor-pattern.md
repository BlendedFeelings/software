# Scheduler Agent Supervisor pattern 
is a software design pattern that is used to manage tasks in a concurrent system. It's particularly useful in scenarios where tasks need to be executed periodically or where the system must handle a large number of tasks in an efficient manner.

Here is a brief overview of each component in the pattern:

1. **Scheduler**: The Scheduler is responsible for managing when tasks are executed. It keeps track of the timing and order of task execution. The Scheduler can be implemented in various ways, such as a simple loop with a sleep interval, a timer-based system, or using more complex scheduling algorithms that take into account task priorities and dependencies.

2. **Agent**: Agents are the workers that perform the actual tasks. Each agent is typically responsible for executing a specific type of task. In a multithreaded environment, each agent could be a thread or a process. Agents fetch tasks from the Scheduler and execute them. After completing a task, they report back to the Supervisor.

3. **Supervisor**: The Supervisor oversees the Agents and the execution of tasks. It is responsible for handling the results of task executions, such as collecting results, handling exceptions, and performing any necessary cleanup. The Supervisor can also be responsible for scaling the number of Agents up or down based on the current workload and for restarting failed Agents.

The Scheduler Agent Supervisor pattern helps to decouple the scheduling of tasks from their execution, which can make the system more scalable and easier to maintain. It also allows for better error handling and resource management.

In practice, this pattern might be used in a distributed system where tasks are scheduled across a cluster of machines, or in an embedded system where tasks must be executed at precise intervals. It's also commonly used in scenarios like web servers, where incoming requests are scheduled and handled by a pool of worker threads (Agents), with a Supervisor monitoring their health and load.

Implementing this pattern typically involves using thread pools, job queues, and synchronization mechanisms such as semaphores or mutexes to ensure that tasks are executed in a thread-safe manner. It is important to consider issues like concurrency, load balancing, and fault tolerance when designing a system that uses the Scheduler Agent Supervisor pattern.
