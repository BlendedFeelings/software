# Throttling 
in software architecture is a pattern used to control the amount of resources a particular component, service, or system can consume during a specific period of time. This is particularly useful in scenarios where resources are limited or costly, and in systems that must handle varying loads while maintaining stability and performance.

The main purpose of throttling is to prevent system overloads and to ensure fair usage of resources among multiple users or services. It can also be used to prevent abuse and to maintain quality of service (QoS).

Here are some key points about the throttling pattern:

1. **Rate Limiting**: Throttling often involves setting a cap on the number of requests that can be made to a system or service within a given time frame. For example, an API might limit clients to 1000 requests per hour.

2. **Resource Allocation**: Throttling can also be applied to the usage of specific resources, such as CPU, memory, or network bandwidth, to prevent any single process from monopolizing them.

3. **Prioritization**: In some cases, throttling mechanisms can prioritize requests based on certain criteria, such as user type (premium vs. free users), request type, or the current load on the system.

4. **Load Shedding**: When the system is under heavy load, throttling can help by shedding less important tasks or by reducing the service level for non-critical operations.

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**: Throttling can provide feedback to the requesting clients or services, usually in the form of HTTP status codes (e.g., 429 Too Many Requests), which can prompt them to reduce their request rate or retry after some time.

6. **Dynamic Throttling**: Some advanced throttling systems can adjust limits dynamically based on current system performance and load, rather than having static limits.

7. **Distributed Throttling**: In distributed systems, throttling may need to be coordinated across multiple nodes to ensure that the aggregate rate does not exceed the desired limits.

8. **Implementation**: Throttling can be implemented using various techniques, such as token bucket, leaky bucket, or fixed window counters.

9. **Compliance and Regulation**: Certain industries may have compliance or regulatory requirements that enforce the use of throttling to ensure fair usage and prevent monopolistic behavior.

10. **User Experience**: While throttling is necessary for the reasons mentioned above, it's important to implement it in a way that minimizes negative impact on user experience. This can involve strategies like graceful degradation of service or informative messaging.

Throttling is a common pattern in cloud services, APIs, web applications, and other distributed systems where demand can be highly variable and resources must be managed effectively.
