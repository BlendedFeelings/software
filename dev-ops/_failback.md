# Failback
is the process of returning a system or application back to its original state or location after a failover event has occurred. 

For example, let's say you have a web application that is hosted on a primary server, and you have set up a backup server to automatically take over in the event of a failure of the primary server. If the backup server takes over and the primary server is repaired or replaced, the process of returning the application to the primary server and resuming normal operation is called Failback.

Failback can involve various steps, such as transferring data and configurations from the backup server back to the primary server, synchronizing the data between the two servers, and testing the primary server to ensure that it is fully functional before resuming normal operation.
