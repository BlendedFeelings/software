# Failover
is a disaster recovery strategy used to ensure that a system or service remains available in the event of a failure of the primary system or component. It involves automatically switching to a backup system or component when the primary system or component fails, so that the system or service can continue to operate without interruption.

For example, let's say you have a web application that is hosted on a primary server. If the server fails, the application would become unavailable to users. To prevent this, you could set up a backup server and configure the application to automatically failover to the backup server in the event of a failure of the primary server.

Failover can be achieved through various techniques, such as clustering, load balancing, and replication. It helps to ensure that critical systems and services remain available and can reduce downtime and disruption in the event of a failure.
