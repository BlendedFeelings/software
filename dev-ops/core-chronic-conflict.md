# DevOps core chronic conflict
typically refers to ongoing, systemic issues within an organization's development and operations practices that lead to inefficiencies, miscommunication, and delays in the software delivery process. These conflicts can arise from a variety of sources, such as:

1. **Cultural Barriers**: Differences in mindset between development teams (focused on change) and operations teams (focused on stability).

2. **Lack of Collaboration**: Insufficient communication and collaboration between teams can lead to silos, where each team is working independently without considering the impact on other teams.

3. **Tooling Mismatch**: Using different or incompatible tools across teams can create friction and inefficiencies.

4. **Process Inconsistencies**: Varied processes across teams can lead to confusion and errors, especially when handoffs occur between teams.

5. **Misaligned Incentives**: When teams have different goals or are measured by different metrics, it can lead to a lack of shared responsibility for the end product.

6. **Resource Constraints**: Limited resources can lead to prioritization conflicts and overburdened staff, affecting both development and operational work.

7. **Technical Debt**: Accumulation of technical debt can slow down new developments and increase the operational burden.

Addressing core chronic conflicts typically involves a combination of cultural change, process improvement, better tooling integration, and fostering a more collaborative environment. This can be achieved through practices such as:

- **Implementing DevOps Principles**: Encouraging a culture of shared responsibility, continuous improvement, and transparency across teams.

- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks to reduce manual errors and free up time for more valuable activities.

- **Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Streamlining the integration and deployment processes to reduce friction and increase the speed of delivery.

- **Cross-functional Teams**: Creating teams that include members from both development and operations to improve collaboration and understanding.

- **Regular Communication**: Establishing regular meetings and communication channels to ensure alignment and quick resolution of issues.

- **Training and Skill Development**: Investing in training to ensure all team members are equipped with the necessary skills to work effectively in a DevOps environment.

- **Measuring and Improving**: Using metrics to track the effectiveness of changes and continuously seeking to improve processes and tools.

By addressing these core chronic conflicts, organizations can improve their overall software delivery performance and create a more effective and efficient DevOps culture.
