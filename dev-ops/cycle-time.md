# Cycle time in DevOps 
is a metric that measures the amount of time it takes for a change to go from inception to being in production, where it delivers value to the user. It is a key performance indicator that helps organizations understand the efficiency and speed of their software development and deployment processes.

The cycle time starts when work begins on a new feature, fix, or improvement and ends when this change is successfully running in production. This encompasses the following stages:

1. **Planning**: Defining the requirements and planning the work.
2. **Development**: Writing, testing, and reviewing code.
3. **Build**: Integrating the code into the main codebase and creating a build.
4. **Testing**: Conducting automated and manual tests to ensure quality.
5. **Release**: Preparing and executing the deployment to production.
6. **Deployment**: The actual process of deploying the new change to production.
7. **Monitoring**: Observing the new change in the production environment to ensure it operates as expected.

To reduce cycle time, organizations often adopt various practices such as:

- **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers regularly merge their code changes into a central repository, where builds and tests are run.
- **Continuous Deployment (CD)**: The latest version of the application is automatically deployed to production whenever a change is made.
- **Automation**: Automating repetitive tasks in the development process, such as testing and deployment.
- **Collaboration**: Encouraging better communication and collaboration between development, operations, and other stakeholders.
- **Lean Practices**: Eliminating waste in the process by removing unnecessary steps or waiting times.

By measuring and optimizing cycle time, organizations can deliver features and fixes more rapidly, respond faster to customer needs, and improve overall productivity and quality.
