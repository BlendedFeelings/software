# DevSecOps 
is an extension of the DevOps philosophy that integrates security practices into the DevOps lifecycle. The term is a combination of development, security, and operations. The main goal of DevSecOps is to bridge traditional gaps between IT and security while ensuring fast, safe delivery of code. In the DevSecOps model, security is a shared responsibility integrated from the start and throughout the software development lifecycle.

Key principles and practices of DevSecOps include:

1. **Shift Left**: Security measures are introduced earlier in the development process (shifted left in the pipeline), which means security considerations are taken into account from the beginning of software design and development, rather than being tacked on at the end.

2. **Automation**: Security testing and compliance monitoring are automated as much as possible to keep pace with the speed of development and deployment. Automation includes integrating security tools into the CI/CD pipeline for static and dynamic analysis, dependency scanning, and more.

3. **Collaboration**: Developers, security professionals, and operations teams work closely together to understand each other's challenges and objectives. This collaboration helps to ensure that security is a shared concern and is addressed continuously.

4. **Security as Code**: Security practices are codified to allow for their automation and integration into the development process. This can include infrastructure as code, policy as code, and compliance as code.

5. **Continuous Learning and Feedback**: Teams continuously learn from security incidents and integrate feedback into their processes to improve security posture. This is often facilitated by post-mortem analyses and sharing lessons learned.

6. **Proactive Security**: Instead of a reactive approach to security, DevSecOps promotes proactive measures such as threat modeling, risk assessment, and hunting for vulnerabilities in the environment.

7. **Governance and Compliance**: DevSecOps practices ensure that security controls are in place to meet governance and compliance requirements from the outset.

8. **Security Training**: Developers are provided with training to write secure code and to understand security best practices, which helps in reducing vulnerabilities at the source.

9. **Tool Integration**: Security tools are integrated into the development and deployment toolchain, providing real-time feedback and allowing for immediate action on security issues.

10. **Continuous Monitoring**: The production environment is continuously monitored for security threats, and automated response mechanisms are in place to deal with potential incidents.

Implementing DevSecOps requires a cultural shift where security is everyone's responsibility, not just the security team's. It also requires investment in training, tools, and processes that support the integration of security into the DevOps pipeline. By doing so, organizations can create a more secure software development lifecycle that is better equipped to handle the evolving threat landscape.
