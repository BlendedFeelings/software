# Immediate rollback 
is the process of reverting a system or application to a previous state, typically because of an error or issue with a recent update or change. This is a critical operation in software deployment and maintenance, as it allows for the quick restoration of service in the event that a new release introduces bugs or other problems that negatively impact users or system stability.

An immediate rollback can be triggered manually by an operator or automatically by a deployment system that detects a failure condition. The process generally involves the following steps:

1. **Detection of a problem**: The issue might be identified through automated monitoring systems, user reports, or by the deployment system itself.
2. **Decision to rollback**: A decision is made to revert to a previous state. This decision could be automated or made by a human operator.
3. **Identification of a stable state**: The system identifies a previously known stable version of the software to which it can revert.
4. **Reversion process**: The system reverts to the identified stable version. This could involve several actions, such as:
   - Stopping the current running version of the software.
   - Restoring databases or data stores to their previous state using backups or snapshots.
   - Re-deploying the previous version of the application code.
   - Re-routing traffic to servers running the stable version.
5. **Verification**: After the rollback, the system is checked to ensure that it is functioning correctly and that the issues caused by the recent update are resolved.
6. **Post-mortem analysis**: Once the immediate crisis is resolved, a detailed analysis is conducted to understand what went wrong and how similar issues can be prevented in the future.

Rollbacks can be part of a broader strategy known as Blue/Green deployment, where two identical production environments are maintained: one "Blue" (current production) and one "Green" (staging or next-in-line production). If a problem is detected in the Blue environment after a release, traffic can be immediately switched back to the Green environment, effectively performing a rollback.

It's important for software systems to have a reliable and tested rollback strategy to minimize downtime and maintain service reliability.
