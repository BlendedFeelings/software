# DevOps information radiator 
is a dynamic display used in software development and IT operations to provide a real-time or near-real-time overview of key indicators of the software delivery process. The purpose of an information radiator is to keep the team informed about the status of various aspects of the development and deployment pipeline, as well as to highlight any issues that need attention.

Here are some common components that might be displayed on a DevOps information radiator:

1. **Continuous Integration (CI) Status**: Shows the latest build status, including successes, failures, and ongoing tests. This can help quickly identify integration issues.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD) Status**: Displays the status of deployment pipelines, indicating which environments have the latest version of the software.

3. **Automated Test Results**: Provides insights into the state of the codebase by showing the results of automated unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.

4. **Code Quality Metrics**: Metrics such as code coverage, static analysis results, code complexity, and technical debt.

5. **Version Control System (VCS) Activity**: Information about recent commits, pull requests, branch status, and repository health.

6. **Infrastructure Monitoring**: Displays the status and health of servers, containers, services, and other infrastructure components.

7. **Application Performance Monitoring (APM)**: Real-time data on application performance, error rates, response times, and user satisfaction scores.

8. **Security Alerts**: Information about security vulnerabilities, code scans, and any breaches or potential threats.

9. **Incident and Problem Management**: Current open issues, incident reports, and tracking of problem resolution.

10. **Work Item Tracking**: Visualization of the progress of stories, tasks, and bugs through the development process, often using a Kanban board or similar tool.

11. **Operational Metrics**: Key performance indicators (KPIs) such as lead time, deployment frequency, mean time to recovery (MTTR), and change failure rate.

12. **Team Availability**: Information about who is available, out of office, or on call.

An information radiator can be implemented using a combination of software tools and dashboards that aggregate data from various sources such as CI/CD tools, version control systems, monitoring services, and project management tools. These dashboards are typically displayed on monitors in common areas where the team can easily see them or made available through web interfaces for remote team members.
