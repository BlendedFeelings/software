# Software craftsmanship 
is an approach to software development that emphasizes the coding skills of the software developers themselves. It advocates for a well-crafted software, just like a skilled craftsman would create a high-quality, handcrafted product. The movement is a reaction to the perceived shortcomings of the traditional engineering-focused approach to software development, and it promotes a more pragmatic and artisanal perspective.

Here are some key principles of software craftsmanship:

1. **Craft over Art**: While software development is a creative process, the craftsmanship movement stresses the importance of delivering value to the client through well-crafted code rather than just creating something beautiful for its own sake.

2. **Quality**: Focus on high-quality work at all times. This includes writing clean, maintainable, and well-tested code.

3. **Continuous Learning**: Encourage continuous professional development and learning new skills. Craftsmen should always strive to improve their craft.

4. **Mentoring**: More experienced craftsmen should mentor apprentices, sharing knowledge and promoting a culture of learning within the community.

5. **Community**: Being part of a community of professionals who share and contribute to each other's growth is important. This can be done through meetups, conferences, online forums, and other collaborative platforms.

6. **Professionalism**: Software craftsmen are expected to behave professionally, which includes having a positive attitude, being responsible for one's work, and treating clients and colleagues with respect.

7. **Pragmatism**: While idealism about perfect code is admirable, craftsmen must also be pragmatic and able to make trade-offs when necessary to deliver value.

8. **Sustainable Pace**: Craftsmen should work at a pace that can be sustained over the long term, avoiding burnout and ensuring consistent productivity.

9. **Pride in Workmanship**: Take pride in the work done, ensuring that it's something that the craftsman and the team can be proud of.

10. **Customer Collaboration**: Work closely with customers to understand their needs and deliver software that truly solves their problems.

The software craftsmanship movement has been influenced by various other movements and methodologies, including agile software development, and it shares some values and principles with them. However, it puts a stronger emphasis on the skill and dedication of the individual developer, promoting the idea that each developer should view their work as a craft to be honed and respected.
