# DevOps value stream mapping (VSM) 
is a visual tool that helps teams understand and improve software delivery processes. It is used to identify and eliminate bottlenecks, reduce waste, and streamline the flow of value from the initial idea to the delivered product or service. VSM in DevOps is an adaptation of the Lean manufacturing technique that maps the flow of materials and information through a production process.

Here's a step-by-step guide to creating a DevOps value stream map:

1. **Identify the Scope and Boundaries**: Define the start and end points of the value stream you want to map. This could be from the moment a new feature is requested to when it's delivered to the customer.

2. **Gather a Cross-Functional Team**: Assemble a team that represents each stage of the value stream, including development, operations, quality assurance, and any other relevant groups.

3. **Map the Current State**: Document each step in the current software delivery process. Include both manual and automated processes, and note the flow of information and artifacts (such as code, builds, and deployments).

4. **Collect Data**: For each step, gather data such as:
   - Lead time (time to move from one step to the next)
   - Process time (time actually spent working on the task)
   - Percentage complete and accurate (quality of the output)
   - Waiting time (time when work is not actively being processed)

5. **Identify Delays and Bottlenecks**: Look for steps with long lead times, high waiting times, or low-quality outputs. These are often indicators of bottlenecks or inefficiencies.

6. **Map the Future State**: Based on the insights from the current state, design a future state map that eliminates waste, reduces waiting times, and improves quality. This might involve automating manual processes, reordering steps, or improving communication and handoffs between teams.

7. **Create an Implementation Plan**: Develop a plan to transition from the current state to the future state. This should include specific actions, responsibilities, and timelines.

8. **Execute and Monitor**: Implement the changes and continuously monitor the process to ensure that improvements are being realized. Use metrics to track progress and make data-driven decisions.

9. **Iterate**: Value stream mapping is not a one-time activity. Regularly revisit the value stream map to identify new opportunities for improvement as the process and organization evolve.

Value stream mapping in DevOps provides several benefits:

- **Visibility**: It offers a clear visualization of the delivery process, making it easier to understand and communicate.

- **Collaboration**: It encourages collaboration across different departments and teams, breaking down silos.

- **Efficiency**: It helps identify waste and inefficiencies, allowing teams to focus on value-adding activities.

- **Continuous Improvement**: It creates a framework for ongoing process improvements, fostering a culture of continuous learning and adaptation.

- **Customer Focus**: It aligns the organization's efforts with customer needs and priorities, ensuring that the end product delivers value.

By using value stream mapping, DevOps teams can drive improvements in their software delivery processes, leading to faster delivery times, higher quality products, and better customer satisfaction.
