# DevOps value stream
refers to the sequence of activities required to design, develop, and deliver a piece of software or a product to the customer. The concept of a value stream is borrowed from Lean manufacturing and is focused on maximizing value creation while minimizing waste.

Mapping the value stream is a key practice in DevOps as it helps organizations understand the flow of work from idea to production, identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and improve the overall efficiency of the software delivery process.

Here are the key components of a DevOps value stream:

1. **Concept**: The value stream begins with an idea or a requirement. This could be a new feature, a bug fix, or any change that needs to be made to the product.

2. **Design and Development**: Once the concept is defined, it moves into the design and development phase where developers write code and create the software.

3. **Continuous Integration (CI)**: Developers frequently merge their code changes into a shared repository, which triggers automated builds and tests to verify that the code integrates well with the existing codebase.

4. **Testing**: The software is subjected to various levels of automated testing to ensure quality, including unit tests, integration tests, and system tests.

5. **Deployment**: The software is deployed to production environments. This can be done manually, but in a mature DevOps setup, it is often automated through continuous delivery (CD) pipelines.

6. **Release**: The software is released to customers. In some DevOps models, this can be a non-event as deployments are done so frequently and reliably that they become routine.

7. **Operation and Monitoring**: Once in production, the software must be maintained and monitored to ensure it is performing as expected. Real-time monitoring and alerting are used to detect and respond to any issues.

8. **Feedback**: Feedback from monitoring tools and from customers is gathered and used to inform future development. This can include performance data, error reports, user experience feedback, and more.

9. **Learning and Improvement**: Insights from feedback and monitoring are used to make improvements to both the product and the process. This might involve refining the value stream itself.

The value stream in DevOps is cyclical, with the learning and improvement phase feeding back into the concept phase for the next cycle of development. By mapping and optimizing the value stream, organizations aim to deliver software faster, with higher quality and better alignment to customer needs, thus providing more value to the business and its customers.
