# You build it, you own it
is a philosophy that suggests that the team or individual responsible for building a piece of software should also be responsible for maintaining it throughout its lifecycle. This approach is closely related to the DevOps movement, which emphasizes collaboration and communication between software developers and other IT professionals while automating the process of software delivery and infrastructure changes.

The "you build it, you own it" model has several key implications:

1. **Accountability**: Developers take full ownership of the code they write, including its performance in production, which can lead to higher quality code and more proactive monitoring and maintenance.

2. **Faster Resolution**: When an issue arises, the developers who built the system are typically the most knowledgeable about it and can often resolve issues more quickly.

3. **Continuous Improvement**: As developers are responsible for the full lifecycle of the software, they are incentivized to design for reliability, monitor effectively, and continuously improve the system to prevent future issues.

4. **Knowledge Retention**: Keeping the original developers involved with the software prevents knowledge loss that can occur when maintenance is handed off to a separate team.

5. **Empowerment**: Developers may feel more empowered and engaged as they see the direct impact of their work on users and the business.

6. **Reduced Handoffs**: Fewer handoffs between teams can lead to fewer miscommunications and delays.

However, this approach also has its challenges, such as:

- It can be demanding for developers to be on call for the systems they've built.
- Developers must have a broader skill set, not just in coding but also in operations, monitoring, and incident response.
- It can lead to silos if not managed properly, where each team only focuses on their own services without considering the broader system.

Overall, "you build it, you own it" is a principle that aims to improve software quality and operational performance by aligning development and operational responsibilities.
