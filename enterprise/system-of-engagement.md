# System of Engagement (SoE)
is designed to facilitate interactions and communications. These systems are used to engage with customers, employees, or partners and to enhance collaboration and productivity. SoEs typically include:

- Social networks and community platforms
- Collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or Asana
- Customer service and support software
- Email and messaging systems
- Mobile and web applications focused on user experience

Characteristics of SoEs include:

- User-friendly interfaces designed for frequent and easy interaction
- Focused on improving the user experience and engagement
- Often integrated with systems of record to pull or push data
- Real-time communication and collaboration capabilities

In many modern organizations, the lines between SoRs and SoEs are increasingly blurring as companies seek to integrate data across different systems to provide a seamless experience for users. This integration allows users to engage with the system of record data through more user-friendly systems of engagement, improving efficiency and satisfaction.
