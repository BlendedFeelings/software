# System of Record (SoR)
is the authoritative data source for a given piece of information within an organization. It is the definitive source where the original data is entered and maintained. SoRs typically include:

- Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems
- Customer Relationship Management (CRM) systems
- Human Resource Management Systems (HRMS)
- Accounting and financial systems
- Databases that store transactional data

Characteristics of SoRs include:

- High data quality and integrity
- Strong security and compliance features
- A focus on data consistency and accuracy
- Often not user-friendly as they are designed for data storage rather than interaction
