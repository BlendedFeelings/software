# Closure 
is a function that captures the lexical scope in which it was defined. This means that the function can remember and access variables from the context in which it was created, even after that context has finished executing. Closures allow for data encapsulation, which can be useful for creating private state and for functional techniques like currying and function factories.

Here's an example of a closure in JavaScript, which is a language that supports functional programming concepts:

```javascript
function createCounter() {
    let count = 0; // `count` is a local variable created by `createCounter`
    return function() {
        count += 1; // The inner function is a closure that has access to `count`
        return count;
    };
}

const counter = createCounter(); // `counter` is now a closure with access to `count`
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 1
console.log(counter()); // Outputs: 2
```

In this example, `createCounter` is a function that returns another function. The inner function has access to the `count` variable from the outer function's scope. This inner function is a closure because it "closes over" the `count` variable, maintaining its state between calls.

Closures are a powerful feature of functional programming languages and are also widely used in many other programming paradigms. They enable the creation of higher-order functions, which are functions that take other functions as arguments or return them as results, thus allowing for more abstract and flexible code.
