# `panic` and `recover` 
are two built-in functions that are used to handle errors and control the flow of a program during runtime. They are part of Go's error handling strategy.

### Panic
A `panic` is a built-in function that stops the ordinary flow of control and begins panicking. When the function `panic` is called, it immediately stops execution of the current function and begins to unwind the stack of function calls until it reaches a point where the panic can be handled or the program terminates.

Here's an example of how to use `panic`:

```go
func mayPanic() {
    panic("a problem has occurred")
}

func main() {
    mayPanic()
    fmt.Println("This will not be printed.")
}
```

When `panic` is called, it will print the panic message and the stack trace, then the program will terminate. The statement `fmt.Println("This will not be printed.")` will not be executed because the function `mayPanic` panics and control never returns to `main`.

### Recover
`recover` is a built-in function that regains control of a panicking goroutine. `recover` is only useful inside deferred functions. During normal execution, a call to `recover` will return `nil` and have no other effect. If the current goroutine is panicking, a call to `recover` will capture the value given to `panic` and resume normal execution.

Here's an example of how to use `recover`:

```go
func mayPanic() {
    defer func() {
        if r := recover(); r != nil {
            fmt.Println("Recovered from panic:", r)
        }
    }()
    panic("a problem has occurred")
}

func main() {
    mayPanic()
    fmt.Println("The function has recovered and this will be printed.")
}
```

In this example, the deferred anonymous function calls `recover`. If there is a panic, `recover` will catch the panic value and the program will continue executing from the point after the `mayPanic` function call, allowing the `main` function to print the message.

Keep in mind that using `panic` and `recover` is not the recommended way to handle errors in Go. The idiomatic way is to use error values, which can be returned from functions and checked by the calling code. `panic` and `recover` are generally reserved for exceptional situations where the program cannot continue execution in a meaningful way.
