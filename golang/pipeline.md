# Pipeline in Go
is a series of stages connected by channels, where each stage is a group of goroutines running the same function. In each stage, goroutines:

1. Receive values from upstream via inbound channels.
2. Perform some function, usually producing new values.
3. Send values downstream via outbound channels.

A pipeline is often used to process streams of data or to perform concurrent operations. Each stage of the pipeline can potentially run concurrently with other stages if it's not dependent on their completion.

Here's a simple example of a pipeline that consists of three stages: generate numbers, square them, and print them.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
)

// Stage 1: Generates numbers from 1 to n.
func generate(n int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 1; i <= n; i++ {
			out <- i
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// Stage 2: Squares the numbers received from the upstream channel.
func square(in <-chan int) <-chan int {
	out := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for v := range in {
			out <- v * v
		}
		close(out)
	}()
	return out
}

// Stage 3: Prints the numbers received from the upstream channel.
func print(in <-chan int, done chan<- struct{}) {
	for v := range in {
		fmt.Println(v)
	}
	done <- struct{}{}
}

func main() {
	// Set up the pipeline.
	gen := generate(10)
	sq := square(gen)

	// Create a channel to signal when the printing is done.
	done := make(chan struct{})

	// Start the printing stage.
	go print(sq, done)

	// Wait for the printing to be done.
	<-done
}
```

In this example, `generate` is the first stage that sends integers from 1 to `n` into a channel. The `square` stage is the second stage that receives integers, squares them, and sends the results to the next stage. The `print` stage is the last one, which prints each squared number it receives and signals completion through a `done` channel.

Each stage runs concurrently using goroutines, and channels are used to pass data between stages. The `main` function sets up the pipeline and waits for the last stage to complete before exiting.

Remember that proper synchronization is crucial when working with concurrent pipelines to avoid deadlocks and ensure that all goroutines finish their work. The `sync` package provides synchronization primitives like `WaitGroup` that can help manage multiple goroutines.
