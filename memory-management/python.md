# Memory management in 
Python is handled automatically by the Python memory manager. The manager allocates memory to new objects and frees it when an object is no longer in use, which is determined by Python's garbage collector. Here's a brief overview of how memory management works in Python:

1. **Allocation**: Python uses a private heap space to allocate memory to objects. This heap is not accessible to the programmer and is managed by the Python memory manager. When you create a new object, the memory manager allocates space on the heap.

2. **Reference Counting**: Python uses reference counting as a primary way to keep track of memory. Each object keeps track of the number of references that point to it. When the reference count drops to zero (meaning no references point to the object), the memory occupied by the object can be freed.

3. **Garbage Collection**: To handle cases where reference cycles occur (where two or more objects reference each other, but are no longer in use), Python has a garbage collector that periodically looks for these cycles and removes them, freeing the memory.

4. **Deallocation**: When objects are no longer needed, Python automatically deallocates the memory, returning it to the heap. This is typically done when the reference count of an object reaches zero.

5. **Memory Pools**: Python uses a system of memory pools (also known as "arenas") for small objects, which can reduce fragmentation and speed up memory allocation. Larger objects are allocated directly on the heap.

6. **Dynamic Typing**: Python is dynamically typed, which means that the type of an object is determined at runtime. This requires additional information to be stored with each object, which can increase the memory overhead.

To manage memory effectively in Python, you can follow some best practices:

- **Minimize references**: Avoid holding onto references that are no longer needed to help the garbage collector free memory more quickly.
  
- **Use built-in data types**: Python's built-in data types are optimized for memory efficiency, so prefer them over custom data structures when possible.

- **Use generators**: Generators can be more memory-efficient than lists or other data structures that store all elements in memory.

- **Profile memory usage**: Tools like `tracemalloc` can help you understand and optimize your program's memory usage.

- **Manual garbage collection**: You can manually trigger the garbage collector using `gc.collect()` if necessary, though in most cases, this is not needed.

Here is a simple example of creating an object and deleting a reference to it:

```python
class MyClass:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value

# Create an object
my_obj = MyClass(10)

# Delete the reference to the object
del my_obj
```

After `del my_obj` is executed, the reference count of the object created by `MyClass(10)` drops to zero, and the memory manager will deallocate the memory for that object.
