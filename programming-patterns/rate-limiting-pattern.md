# Rate Limiting pattern 
is a software design pattern that is used to control the rate at which an application or a service processes requests. It is an important mechanism for controlling traffic and preventing abuse, ensuring that a service can handle a high number of requests without being overwhelmed or crashing. Rate limiting is commonly used in web APIs, where it helps to maintain quality of service and fairness among users.

Here are some key aspects of the Rate Limiting pattern:

1. **Thresholds**: The pattern involves setting a maximum number of requests that can be made within a certain time period (e.g., 1000 requests per hour).

2. **Tracking**: The application tracks the number of requests made by each user or IP address to determine if the threshold has been reached.

3. **Limiting**: Once a user reaches the threshold, the application will block or delay additional requests from that user until the rate limit resets.

4. **Resetting**: The rate limit is typically reset after a certain time period has elapsed (e.g., every hour or day).

5. **Feedback**: The application often provides feedback to the user when a rate limit has been reached, such as returning an HTTP 429 Too Many Requests status code.

6. **Policies**: Different users or types of requests may have different rate limits. For example, premium users might have a higher limit than free users, and read requests might be less restricted than write requests.

7. **Scalability**: Rate limiting mechanisms should be able to scale with the application, handling more users and requests as the service grows.

8. **Distributed Systems**: In distributed systems, rate limiting can be more complex, as it may need to be coordinated across multiple servers or data centers.


Example:

```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, capacity, refill_rate):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.refill_rate = refill_rate
        self.tokens = capacity
        self.last_refill_timestamp = current_timestamp()
    
    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        current_time = current_timestamp()
        time_since_last_refill = current_time - self.last_refill_timestamp
        tokens_to_add = time_since_last_refill * self.refill_rate
        
        if tokens_to_add > 0:
            self.tokens = min(self.capacity, self.tokens + tokens_to_add)
            self.last_refill_timestamp = current_time
        
        if self.tokens >= 1:
            self.tokens -= 1
            return True
        else:
            return False

# Usage
rate_limiter = RateLimiter(capacity=100, refill_rate=1) # 100 requests per second
if rate_limiter.allow_request(user_id):
    # Process the request
else:
    # Reject the request and inform the user
```
