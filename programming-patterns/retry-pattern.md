# Retry Pattern
is a software design pattern that enables an application to handle transient failures by transparently retrying a failed operation. Transient failures are temporary and are often self-correcting, such as a momentary loss of network connectivity, a temporary unavailability of a service, or timeouts that occur when a service is busy. These failures do not necessarily imply a defect in the application or a permanent fault in the system.

Here's how a Retry Pattern can be implemented:

1. **Identify Operations to Retry**: Determine which operations are likely to fail due to transient issues and would benefit from being retried.

2. **Define Retry Policy**: Establish the rules for retrying, including:
   - **Number of retries**: How many times the operation will be attempted before giving up.
   - **Delay between retries**: The waiting time between attempts, which can be constant, incremental, or exponential.
   - **Retry conditions**: The specific exceptions or error conditions that will trigger a retry.

3. **Implement Retry Logic**: Write the code that encapsulates the operation and applies the retry policy. This often involves a loop or recursive function that catches exceptions and retries the operation according to the policy.

4. **Consider Jitter**: To prevent overloading the system when many instances of an application retry at the same time, introduce randomness into the delay between retries (jitter).

5. **Monitor and Log**: Keep track of retries and log failures to help with diagnosing issues and fine-tuning the retry policy.

6. **Fallback Strategies**: In case the maximum number of retries is reached without success, have a fallback strategy in place. This could involve switching to a backup system, informing the user, or failing gracefully.

```java
class MyClass 
{
    void Retry(int maxRetries, int delayInSeconds)
    {
        int retries = 0;
        while (true)
        {
            retries++;
            try
            {
                // some operation
            }
            catch (Exception ex)
            {
                if (retries == maxRetries)
                    throw ex;
                Sleep(delayInSeconds);
            }
        }
    }
}
