# Keywords in Python
are reserved words that have special meanings and purposes. These words cannot be used as identifiers, such as variable names, function names, or any other identifiers. Here's a list of Python keywords as of Python 3.9:

```python
False      await      else       import     pass
None       break      except     in         raise
True       class      finally    is         return
and        continue   for        lambda     try
as         def        from       nonlocal   while
assert     del        global     not        with
async      elif       if         or         yield
```

These keywords are the core building blocks of the Python language syntax and structure. They are used to define the structure and flow of a Python program. Each keyword has its own functionality, for example:

- `if`, `elif`, and `else` are used for conditional statements.
- `for` and `while` are used for looping constructs.
- `def` is used for defining functions.
- `class` is used for defining classes.
- `try`, `except`, `finally` are used for handling exceptions.
- `with` is used for simplifying exception handling when dealing with resource management.
- `import` is used for importing modules.
- `from` is used to import specific attributes or functions from a module.
- `as` is used to create an alias while importing a module.
- `return` is used to return a value from a function.
- `yield` is used to return a value from a generator.
- `lambda` is used to create anonymous functions.
- `and`, `or`, `not` are logical operators.
- `is` is used to test object identity.
- `global` and `nonlocal` are used to declare variables to be at the global or nonlocal scope.
- `assert` is used for debugging purposes to check if a condition is True.
- `async` and `await` are used to define and work with asynchronous code.

Remember that Python is case-sensitive, so these keywords must be used exactly as they are written here.
