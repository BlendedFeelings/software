# Rename Method 
refactoring technique is used when the name of a method no longer clearly describes what the method does. This could be due to changes in the method's body, changes in the understanding of what the method should do, or simply because the original name was not chosen well. Renaming a method to a more descriptive and accurate name can improve code readability and maintainability.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to apply the "Rename Method" refactoring technique:

1. **Identify Method to Rename**: Find a method whose name does not accurately reflect its purpose or is not clear enough.

2. **Check for Overriding/Overloaded Methods**: If the method is part of a class hierarchy or is overloaded, ensure that renaming it does not cause conflicts or misunderstandings in the context of the hierarchy or overloads.

3. **Rename Method**: Change the method's name to a new name that better describes its functionality. If you're using an IDE with refactoring support, it can automatically update all references to the method.

4. **Update All References**: If not using an automated tool, manually update all calls to the method throughout the codebase to use the new name.

5. **Test**: Run your tests to ensure that the behavior of the program remains unchanged. This step verifies that all references to the method have been updated correctly.

Here's an example in C#:

Before refactoring:

```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    // Method name is not clear
    public void Check(Order order)
    {
        // Code to validate the order
    }
}
```

After applying "Rename Method" refactoring:

```csharp
public class OrderProcessor
{
    // Method name is now more descriptive
    public void ValidateOrder(Order order)
    {
        // Code to validate the order
    }
}
```

In this example, the `Check` method was renamed to `ValidateOrder`, which more clearly indicates that the method is responsible for validating the order. This makes the code easier to understand for anyone reading or maintaining it in the future.
