# Data Breach Investigations Report (DBIR)
is an annual report published by Verizon that provides analysis on information security incidents and data breaches. The report is well-known in the cybersecurity industry for its comprehensive examination of the tactics, techniques, and procedures used by cybercriminals, as well as insights into trends and patterns in cyberattacks.

The DBIR compiles data from thousands of confirmed data breaches and security incidents from various sources around the world, including law enforcement agencies, security firms, and other contributors. The report covers various aspects of cybersecurity, such as:

1. **Executive Summary**: A brief overview of the report's findings, highlighting the key trends and changes in the data breach landscape.

2. **Methodology**: An explanation of the data collection process, sources, and analytical methods used to compile the report.

3. **Incident Classifications**: Classification of security incidents and breaches into patterns such as Web Application Attacks, Cyber-Espionage, Insider Threats, Point of Sale Intrusions, etc.

4. **Threat Actor Information**: Insights into who is behind the breaches, including categorization into groups like external actors, internal actors, partners, etc., and their motives (financial, espionage, grudge, etc.).

5. **Victim Demographics**: Analysis of the types of organizations targeted, including industry sectors, business sizes, and geographical locations.

6. **Action Varieties in Incidents**: A breakdown of the actions taken by threat actors, such as hacking, malware deployment, social engineering, misuse, physical actions, and errors.

The DBIR is considered a valuable resource for cybersecurity professionals, IT managers, policymakers, and business leaders as it helps them understand the current threat landscape and make informed decisions about their security strategies. It can also be used to benchmark an organization's security performance against industry standards and to identify areas that may require additional protection or investment.
