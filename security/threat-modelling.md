# Threat Modelling
is a process of identifying potential security threats and vulnerabilities in a software system. This helps in identifying and mitigating risks early on in the development process.

Step by step process of Threat Modelling:

1. Identify the scope of the project: This involves defining the boundaries of the software system and the components that need to be analysed.

2. Create a data flow diagram: This helps in understanding how data flows within the system and identifying the potential entry points for attackers.

3. Identify potential threats: This involves brainstorming potential threats that could exploit vulnerabilities in the system. Examples include SQL injections, cross-site scripting, and buffer overflows.

4. Analyse and rate the threats: Each threat is analysed to determine the likelihood of it occurring and the potential impact it could have on the system. This helps in prioritising the threats based on their severity.

5. Develop countermeasures: Once the threats have been identified and prioritised, countermeasures are developed to mitigate the risks. This could involve implementing security controls, redesigning the system architecture, or implementing secure coding practices.

6. Test and validate: The effectiveness of the countermeasures is tested and validated to ensure that they are effective in mitigating the identified risks.

7. Review and update: Threat modelling is an iterative process, and it is important to review and update the model regularly to ensure that it remains effective in identifying and mitigating new threats.
