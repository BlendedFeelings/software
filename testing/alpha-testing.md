# Alpha testing 
is a type of software testing performed to identify bugs before releasing the product to real users or the public. It is the first phase of software testing and is typically performed by internal staff, often in a lab environment. The main focus of alpha testing is to ensure that the software product works according to the specifications and requirements laid out by the development team.

Key characteristics of alpha testing include:

1. **Internal Affair**: It is conducted by employees of the organization that develops the software, not by the end-users.

2. **Controlled Environment**: Testing is usually done in a controlled environment, which can be a testing lab. The environment is designed to closely replicate the end-user's operating conditions.

3. **Functionality Verification**: The primary goal is to verify that the core functionalities of the software work as expected.

4. **Bug Fixing**: Any bugs or issues discovered during alpha testing are reported and fixed before the software moves to the next phase of testing.

5. **Simulated or Actual Use**: Testers may use a combination of white-box and black-box testing techniques. They simulate user behavior to uncover any issues that could affect the user experience.

6. **Feedback Loop**: There is often a feedback loop to the development team so that issues can be addressed promptly.

7. **Multiple Rounds**: Alpha testing can involve multiple rounds of testing as bugs are fixed and new features are added.

8. **Confidential**: Since it is an internal process, details about the software are typically kept confidential and not released to the public.

After alpha testing, the software usually moves into beta testing, where it is exposed to a wider audience outside of the organization. This helps to gather feedback from actual users and to ensure that the software works in diverse real-world environments.
