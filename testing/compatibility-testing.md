# Compatibility testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that ensures a software application, product, or system operates as expected across different environments, including various hardware, operating systems, network environments, and mobile devices. The primary goal of compatibility testing is to identify and resolve any compatibility issues before the product is released to end-users.

Here are some key aspects of compatibility testing:

1. **Hardware Compatibility**: The application is tested against different hardware configurations to ensure it works correctly on each one. This includes testing with different processors, memory, disk space, and other peripheral devices such as printers and scanners.

2. **Operating System Compatibility**: The application is tested on different operating systems (like Windows, macOS, Linux) and their different versions to ensure that it behaves consistently across all of them.

3. **Browser Compatibility**: For web applications, browser compatibility testing is crucial. It involves testing the application on different web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) and their various versions to ensure that web pages render and function correctly.

4. **Network Compatibility**: This involves testing the application in various network environments and conditions, including different bandwidths, protocols, and connection speeds, to ensure consistent performance.

5. **Mobile Devices Compatibility**: With the proliferation of mobile devices, it's important to test applications on various mobile platforms (iOS, Android) and devices with different screen sizes and resolutions.

6. **Software Compatibility**: The application is tested for its compatibility with other software programs, for example, database management systems (DBMS), third-party libraries, or software dependencies.

7. **Version Compatibility**: This ensures that the application works well with different versions of itself, which is particularly important for software updates and backward compatibility.

8. **User Interface (UI) Compatibility**: This ensures that the UI of the application is consistent and functional across different resolutions, screen sizes, and orientations.

Compatibility testing can be performed manually or using automated tools. It is an important part of the testing process as it helps to prevent issues that could limit the reach or functionality of the software when used in different environments. It also helps to improve user satisfaction and reduces the risk of failures due to incompatibility in the production environment.
