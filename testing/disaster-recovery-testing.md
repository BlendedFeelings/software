# Disaster recovery testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that is a critical component of an organization's disaster recovery plan (DRP) and business continuity strategy. It involves simulating a variety of disaster scenarios to ensure that an organization's IT infrastructure, data, and services can be restored to operational status following a catastrophic event, such as a natural disaster, cyberattack, hardware failure, or human error.

The main goals of disaster recovery testing are to:

1. **Verify Recovery Procedures**: Ensure that the disaster recovery procedures outlined in the DRP work as expected and can be executed within the designated recovery time objectives (RTOs) and recovery point objectives (RPOs).

2. **Identify Weaknesses**: Discover any flaws or gaps in the disaster recovery plan that could prevent a successful recovery.

3. **Train Staff**: Provide hands-on experience for the IT staff and other employees involved in the recovery process so they understand their roles and responsibilities during an actual disaster.

4. **Ensure Data Integrity**: Confirm that backup data is complete, accurate, and can be restored to a usable state.

5. **Test Failover and Failback**: Evaluate the ability to switch operations to a secondary site (failover) and then return operations to the primary site once it is back online (failback).

6. **Validate Communication Plans**: Check that communication channels and protocols work effectively among the disaster recovery team and with external stakeholders.

Disaster recovery testing typically involves the following types of tests:

- **Checklist Tests**: Reviewing the DRP documentation to ensure that all steps and procedures are up-to-date and comprehensive.

- **Tabletop Exercises**: Conducting structured discussions with the disaster recovery team to walk through the plan and discuss responses to hypothetical disaster scenarios.

- **Simulation Tests**: Creating a simulated environment to mimic a disaster and observing how the disaster recovery procedures are executed without impacting actual operations.

- **Full Interruption Tests**: Physically shutting down operations at the primary site to test the failover to the secondary site. This type of test is the most comprehensive but also the riskiest, as it involves actual downtime.

- **Parallel Tests**: Running systems in parallel at both the primary and recovery sites to validate that the secondary site can handle the load without switching live operations.

Disaster recovery testing should be conducted regularly to ensure that the DRP remains effective over time, especially as changes occur in the organization's IT environment. It is also important to document the results of each test, analyze the outcomes, and update the DRP accordingly to address any identified issues.

By performing disaster recovery testing, organizations can build confidence in their ability to recover from disasters, minimize potential downtime, and reduce the risk of data loss, ultimately protecting their operations and reputation.
