# Functional testing
Functional testing is a way to check that a software program does what it's supposed to do. It involves testing each function of the software to make sure it works correctly and meets the requirements it was designed for. This type of testing doesn't look at the code inside; it just checks the features by giving inputs and seeing if the outputs are as expected.

is a type of software testing that validates the software system components against the functional requirements/specifications. The purpose of functional testing is to test each function of the software application, by providing appropriate input, verifying the output against the Functional requirements.

This type of testing checks the user interface, APIs, databases, security, client/server applications and functionality of the Application Under Test. The testing can be done either manually or using automation.

Key aspects of functional testing include:

1. **Input Testing**: Checking the application's response to given inputs.

2. **User Interface Testing**: Ensuring that the user interface meets requirements and is user-friendly.

3. **Database Testing**: Verifying that data is being stored, retrieved and updated correctly.

4. **APIs and Integrations Testing**: Making sure that APIs and other integrated services or systems work as expected.

5. **Business Workflow Testing**: Testing the business processes implemented within the application.

6. **Security and Access Control Testing**: Ensuring that the application has the necessary protections against unauthorized access and data breaches.

Functional testing generally involves the following steps:

1. **Understanding Requirements**: The first step is to thoroughly understand the functional specifications and requirements of the system.

2. **Test Planning**: Based on the requirements, a detailed test plan is created outlining what is to be tested, how it is to be tested, and the expected outcomes.

3. **Test Case Design**: Test cases are designed for various functions to cover all possible scenarios, including boundary cases and error paths.

4. **Test Environment Setup**: A test environment that closely resembles the production environment is set up to execute the test cases.

5. **Test Execution**: The test cases are executed, and the actual results are compared with the expected results.

6. **Defect Logging**: Any discrepancies found during test execution are logged as defects, and the development team is notified to fix them.

7. **Retesting and Regression Testing**: After defects are fixed, the failed test cases are re-executed to verify the fixes. Regression testing is also performed to ensure that new changes have not adversely affected existing functionalities.

8. **Test Closure**: Once testing is complete, a test closure report is prepared, which includes a summary of the testing activities and any unresolved issues.

Functional testing includes various types of testing like:

- **[Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)**: Testing individual components or pieces of code for a system.

- **[Integration Testing](integration-testing.md)**: Testing the interfaces between components and interactions to different parts of the system such as an operating system, file system, and hardware or interfaces between systems.

- **[System Testing](security-testing.md)**: Testing the complete and fully integrated software product.

- **[Sanity Testing](sanity-testing.md)**: Testing to determine if a new software version is performing well enough to accept it for a major testing effort.

- **[Smoke Testing](smoke-testing.md)**: Preliminary testing to reveal simple failures severe enough to reject a prospective software release.

- **Interface Testing**: Testing to determine if the interfaces between components and systems are working as defined.

- **[Acceptance Testing](acceptance-testing.md)**: Testing to determine if the system satisfies the business requirements and to enable the customer to determine whether to accept the system.

- **[Regression Testing](regression-testing.md)**: Testing the application as a whole after the modification of any module or functionality to ensure that existing functionality works fine.

- **[Beta Testing](beta-testing.md)**: Releasing the software to a limited audience outside of the company to get feedback from the user perspective.

Functional testing is a cornerstone of the testing process, as it is directly concerned with the behavior of the software. It aims to verify that the software is ready for release and meets the user's requirements in terms of functionality and usability.
