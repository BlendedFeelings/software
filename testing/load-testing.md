# Load testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that involves simulating real-life user load for the target software, application, or website to determine how the system behaves under anticipated normal and peak load conditions. The primary purpose of load testing is to identify and measure the system's key performance indicators under simulated conditions that mimic actual use.

### Objectives of Load Testing:
- **Performance Measurement**: To assess the response times, throughput rates, and resource-utilization levels of a system under a given load.
- **Capacity Planning**: To determine how many users and transactions a system can handle before performance degrades to unacceptable levels.
- **Scalability**: To understand if the system can scale up or out, and how it does so, to accommodate increasing loads.
- **Bottleneck Identification**: To pinpoint the parts of the system that become performance constraints under high load.

### Process of Load Testing:
1. **Planning**: Define the load testing goals and objectives, identify the performance acceptance criteria, and determine the scenarios to be tested.
2. **Designing Load Scenarios**: Develop realistic user scenarios for the load test, including the types of transactions and the mix of operations.
3. **Creating Load Scripts**: Write scripts that automate user actions to simulate concurrent users and transactions on the system.
4. **Setting Up the Test Environment**: Prepare a testing environment that closely mirrors the production environment, including hardware, software, network configurations, and databases.
5. **Executing the Test**: Run the load test by gradually increasing the number of virtual users or transactions to the desired levels and monitor system performance.
6. **Monitoring and Recording**: Collect performance data from the system, which may include response times, throughput rates, error rates, and system resource utilization.
7. **Analysis**: Analyze the data collected to determine how the system performed under load, identify any performance issues, and compare the results with the performance acceptance criteria.
8. **Reporting**: Document the findings, including any performance bottlenecks, and make recommendations for improvements.

### Tools Used in Load Testing:
- **JMeter**: An open-source load testing tool for analyzing and measuring the performance of a variety of services.
- **LoadRunner**: A widely used load testing tool by Micro Focus that can simulate thousands of users concurrently using application software.
- **BlazeMeter**: A platform for load and performance testing that supports open-source tools like JMeter.
- **Gatling**: A high-performance load testing tool for web applications, designed for ease of use and extensibility.

### Importance of Load Testing:
- **Ensures Performance**: Ensures that the application can handle the expected number of users and transactions without adverse effects on performance.
- **Prevents Overload**: Prevents system overload by identifying the maximum operating capacity of an application as well as any bottlenecks that could interfere with its operation.
- **Improves User Experience**: A system that performs well under load leads to a better user experience, which can translate to higher satisfaction and retention rates.
- **Supports Business Requirements**: Helps to ensure that the system meets the performance criteria required to support business goals and objectives.

Load testing is crucial for applications and systems that expect to serve a high number of users simultaneously. It provides insight into the performance characteristics of the system and helps ensure that users receive a fast and positive experience. It is a key practice for applications that are critical to business operations, especially for e-commerce sites, online services, and other systems where performance is closely tied to business success.
