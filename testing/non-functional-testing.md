# Non-functional testing 
refers to the type of testing that is performed to evaluate the non-functional aspects of a software application, such as its performance, usability, reliability, and security, rather than its specific behaviors or functions (which are covered by functional testing).

Here are some key types of non-functional testing:

1. **[Performance Testing](performance-testing.md)**: This tests how the application behaves under certain conditions, including its response time, throughput, and stability under various levels of load. It often includes load testing, stress testing, and spike testing.

2. **[Usability Testing](usability-testing.md)**: This assesses how easy and user-friendly the application is for end-users. It involves evaluating the user interface design, consistency, and the overall user experience.

3. **[Reliability Testing](reliability-testing.md)**: This type of testing checks the software's ability to perform a specified task under certain conditions for a specified period. It involves testing for mean time between failures (MTBF) and recovery time after a failure.

4. **[Security Testing](security-testing.md)**: This tests the application's ability to protect data and maintain functionality as intended. It includes checking for vulnerabilities to attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting, and other security threats.

5. **[Compatibility Testing](compatibility-testing.md)**: As previously described, this ensures that the software works as expected across different devices, operating systems, browsers, and other environments.

6. **[Scalability Testing](scalability-testing.md)**: This determines if the application can handle an increasing workload, such as a higher number of transactions or more concurrent users, without compromising performance.

7. **[Volume Testing](volume-testing.md)**: This checks the application's ability to handle a large volume of data. It is particularly important for applications that deal with large databases.

8. **[Stress Testing](stress-testing.md)**: This involves testing the application under extreme conditions, such as high data processing rates or lack of computing resources, to see how it behaves under stress and when it fails.

9. **[Maintainability Testing](maintainability-testing.md)**: This assesses how easily the software can be maintained. This includes evaluating the code for understandability, simplicity, and ease of modification.

10. **[Portability Testing](portability-testing.md)**: This checks the ease with which the software can be moved from one environment to another. This includes testing for compatibility with different hardware, operating systems, and software environments.

11. **[Disaster Recovery Testing](disaster-recovery-testing.md)**: This ensures that the software can recover from crashes, hardware failures, and other problems, and that it can return to its previous state with minimal data loss.

Non-functional testing is critical to ensure that the software meets its required quality attributes and provides a good user experience. It is usually performed after functional testing and can be conducted manually or automated using specialized testing tools.
