# Performance testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that is conducted to determine how a system performs in terms of responsiveness and stability under a particular workload. It is not about finding bugs in the software but about identifying performance bottlenecks and ensuring that the software meets the performance criteria established during the earlier stages of development.

Key aspects of performance testing include:

### Objectives of Performance Testing:
- **Speed**: To determine whether the application responds quickly.
- **Scalability**: To determine the maximum user load the software application can handle.
- **Stability**: To ensure the application is stable under varying loads.
- **Reliability**: To check if the application performs consistently under different conditions.

### Types of Performance Testing:
- **Load Testing**: Checks the application's ability to perform under anticipated user loads. The objective is to identify performance bottlenecks before the software application goes live.
- **Stress Testing**: Involves testing an application under extreme workloads to see how it handles high traffic or data processing. The goal is to identify the breaking point of an application.
- **Endurance Testing**: Also known as soak testing, involves testing a system with a typical workload over a long period to identify performance issues that may arise with sustained use.
- **Spike Testing**: Tests the software's reaction to sudden large spikes in the load generated by users.
- **Volume Testing**: Under volume testing, large numbers of data are populated in a database, and the overall software system's behavior is monitored. The goal is to check software application performance under varying database volumes.
- **Scalability Testing**: Determines if the software application scales for an increased user load. This involves gradually increasing the user load while monitoring system performance and identifying at which point the system's response time becomes unacceptable.

### Process of Performance Testing:
1. **Identify the Test Environment**: Know the physical test environment, production environment, and what testing tools are available.
2. **Determine Performance Metrics**: Identify the key performance indicators like response time, throughput, and resource utilization.
3. **Plan and Design Performance Tests**: Define the performance test scenarios that cover all user variations, outline test data, and establish metrics to be collected.
4. **Configure the Test Environment**: Prepare the test environment, tools, and resources necessary to execute each scenario.
5. **Implement the Test Design**: Create the performance tests according to your test design.
6. **Execute the Test**: Run and monitor the tests.
7. **Analyze, Tune, and Retest**: Consolidate, analyze results, and share findings. Fine-tune and test again to see if there is an improvement or degradation in performance.

### Tools Used in Performance Testing:
There are many performance testing tools available, which can simulate hundreds or thousands of concurrent users. Some popular tools include:

- **LoadRunner**: A widely used performance testing tool from Micro Focus.
- **JMeter**: An open-source tool designed for performance testing.
- **NeoLoad**: A load and performance testing tool designed to test web and mobile applications.
- **WebLOAD**: A powerful tool for load, stress, and performance testing web applications.

### Importance of Performance Testing:
Performance testing is critical for the success of a software product. Poor performance can lead to customer dissatisfaction, loss of revenue, and damage to a company's reputation. It helps to:

- Verify the software's reliability, scalability, and resource usage.
- Identify and eliminate performance bottlenecks.
- Ensure the software meets performance criteria.
- Provide stakeholders with information about their application's speed, stability, and scalability.

Performance testing should be an integral part of the software development lifecycle, and it is especially important for mission-critical applications where downtime can have significant business impacts.
