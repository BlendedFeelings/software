# Portability testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) conducted to assess the ease with which a software application can be transferred from one environment to another. This includes testing the application across different platforms, such as operating systems, hardware configurations, databases, browsers, and devices. The goal of portability testing is to ensure that the software is adaptable and can function correctly in various environments without the need for extensive changes.

Key aspects of portability testing include:

1. **Adaptability**: Evaluating how easily the software can adapt to changes in its environment without excessive additional work.

2. **Installability**: Testing the ease with which the software can be installed in different environments.

3. **Co-existence**: Assessing whether the software can coexist with other independent software in a common environment sharing common resources.

4. **Replaceability**: Checking if the software can replace another specified software in the environment of that software.

5. **Compatibility**: Ensuring the software is compatible with different versions of operating systems, browsers, databases, and other system software.

Portability testing involves the following activities:

- **Planning**: Define the scope and objectives of portability testing, including identifying the environments in which the application is expected to operate.

- **Preparation**: Set up the necessary environments for testing, which may involve configuring hardware, installing operating systems, setting up databases, etc.

- **Execution**: Run the software application in each of the identified environments and perform functional and non-functional tests to check for any discrepancies in behavior or performance.

- **Analysis**: Record the results of the tests, including any issues or failures, and analyze them to determine the root cause.

- **Reporting**: Document the findings and provide recommendations for enhancing the portability of the application.

Portability testing can be performed manually or with the help of automated tools that simulate different environments. It is an important aspect of the software development lifecycle, especially for applications that are intended to be platform-independent or need to support a wide range of devices and systems.

By conducting portability testing, developers can identify potential deployment issues early in the development process, which can save time and resources in the long run. It also helps ensure a better user experience, as users can expect consistent functionality and performance across different platforms.
