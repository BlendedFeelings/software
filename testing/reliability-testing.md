# Reliability testing 
is a category of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that focuses on verifying that a software application is capable of performing a required function under specified conditions for a specific period of time without failure. It is concerned with the consistency of the software's performance and its ability to maintain its level of effectiveness when faced with different conditions.

The main goal of reliability testing is to identify and fix any issues that could cause the software to fail, ensuring that the system is dependable and can be trusted by users. The reliability of a software system can be affected by bugs, system crashes, hardware failures, or any external factors that can lead to unexpected behaviour.

Here are some key aspects of reliability testing:

1. **Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF)**: This is a measure of how frequently a system fails. It is the average time interval between inherent failures of a system during operation.

2. **Mean Time To Failure (MTTF)**: This measures the expected time to the first failure for a non-repairable system.

3. **Mean Time To Repair (MTTR)**: This represents the average time required to repair a failed system or component and restore it to operational status.

4. **Recovery Testing**: This is a process to determine how well an application can recover from crashes, hardware failures, or other catastrophic problems.

5. **Load Testing**: This involves testing the application under normal and peak load conditions to ensure that it can perform its intended functions without failure.

6. **Failover Testing**: This tests the software's ability to allocate extra resource and to move operations to back-up systems during a failure to ensure continuous operations.

Reliability testing can be conducted in different phases of the software development lifecycle. It often includes rigorous and repeated testing cycles to simulate different conditions and use cases. The focus is on finding and fixing issues that could lead to system failure, thus improving the overall stability and dependability of the software.

It is important to note that reliability is not just about the absence of failures; it also involves the ability of the software to operate at a specified level of performance over time. This means that reliability testing is closely related to performance testing, stress testing, and other non-functional testing types that help ensure the software's robustness and stability.
