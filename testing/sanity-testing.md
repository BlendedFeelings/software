# Sanity testing 
is a subset of regression testing. It is a type of software testing that is performed to ensure that a specific function or bug fix in the application is working as expected. This kind of testing is usually narrow and deep, meaning it focuses on one or a few areas of functionality rather than a broad and shallow approach like smoke testing.

Sanity testing is often done when a new build of the software is received, with minor changes or when a specific issue has been fixed. The purpose is to determine that the proposed functionality works roughly as expected. If the sanity test fails, the build is rejected to save time and costs involved in more rigorous testing.

The main characteristics of sanity testing are:

- It is typically unscripted.
- It is used to check particular functionality after minor changes.
- It is a quick and dirty test to check the functionality, not a thorough testing.
- It is usually performed by testers who have a good understanding of the software.

The term "sanity test" can sometimes be used interchangeably with "smoke test", but they are different in their focus. Smoke testing is a broader approach to ensure that the most important functions work, but does not go into as much depth as sanity testing.
