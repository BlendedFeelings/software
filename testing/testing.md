# Testing 
is to evaluate the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of a software application or system. Testing can help to ensure that the software meets the specified requirements and identify any defects or issues before the software is deployed to users. There are various types of software testing, each with specific objectives and techniques:

1. **[Unit Testing](unit-testing.md)**: This involves testing individual components or units of code to ensure that they function correctly in isolation. Unit tests are typically written by developers as they write their code.

2. **[Integration Testing](integration-testing.md)**: This type of testing checks the interactions between different modules or services in a system to ensure they work together as expected.

3. **[System Testing](system-testing.md)**: This is a high-level test that validates the complete and integrated software product against the specified requirements.

4. **[Acceptance Testing](acceptance-testing.md)**: Also known as User Acceptance Testing (UAT), this is performed to determine if the system satisfies the business requirements and is ready for release. It is often done by the end-users.

5. **[Functional Testing](functional-testing.md)**: This focuses on testing the software against its functional requirements to ensure that it behaves as expected.

6. **[Non-Functional Testing](non-functional-testing.md)**: This type of testing evaluates aspects of the software that are not related to specific behaviors or functions, such as performance, scalability, security, and usability.

7. **[Regression Testing](regression-testing.md)**: This is conducted to ensure that new code changes have not adversely affected existing functionality.

8. **[Smoke Testing](smoke-testing.md)**: Also known as "build verification testing," it is a preliminary test to reveal simple failures severe enough to reject a prospective software release.

9. **[Exploratory Testing](exploratory-testing.md)**: This is an approach where testers explore the software to identify defects without predefined test cases.

10. **[Performance Testing](performance-testing.md)**: This type of testing is done to evaluate how the system performs under various conditions, including load testing, stress testing, and spike testing.

11. **[Security Testing](security-testing.md)**: This is focused on finding vulnerabilities in the software that could allow unauthorized access or data breaches.

12. **[Usability Testing](usability-testing.md)**: It assesses how easy the software is to use by real users.

13. **[Compatibility Testing](functional-testing.md)**: This ensures that the software works as expected across different hardware, operating systems, browsers, and networks.

14. **[Localization Testing](functional-testing.md)**: This checks that the software is appropriately localized for a particular region, including language, formatting, and cultural norms.

15. **Alpha and Beta Testing**: Alpha testing is performed by internal staff before the software is released to external users, while beta testing is performed by a select group of external users before the final release.

Software testing can be conducted manually or with the support of automated tools. The choice between manual and automated testing depends on various factors, including the complexity of the tests, the frequency with which they need to be run, the stage of development, and the resources available.
