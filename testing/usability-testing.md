# Usability testing 
is a type of [non-functional testing](non-functional-testing.md) that is a technique used in user-centered interaction design to evaluate a product by testing it on users. This can be seen as an irreplaceable usability practice since it gives direct input on how real users use the system. It is concerned with the effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction with which specified users can achieve specified goals in particular environments.

### Objectives of Usability Testing:
- **Effectiveness**: How well users can complete tasks using the product and how many errors they make along the way.
- **Efficiency**: How quickly users can complete tasks once they are familiar with the interface.
- **Satisfaction**: How much the users enjoy using the system's interface.
- **Learnability**: How easy it is for new users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they encounter the design.
- **Memorability**: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how easily can they reestablish proficiency?

### Types of Usability Testing:
- **Hallway Testing**: Randomly selecting people (often from within the company) to try using the product.
- **Remote Usability Testing**: Conducting a usability test with participants who are in a different location from the tester.
- **Expert Review**: Having usability experts review your product and provide feedback based on heuristics (established usability principles).
- **Paper Prototype Testing**: Testing the design of the product early in the development process by using paper versions of interfaces.
- **A/B Testing**: Comparing two versions of a product to see which one performs better on certain metrics.

### Process of Usability Testing:
1. **Planning**: Define the goals of the test, decide on the user profiles, and create a test plan outlining the methodology.
2. **Recruiting Participants**: Select participants who represent the actual user base of the product.
3. **Designing Test Tasks**: Create realistic scenarios that are likely to occur when using the product.
4. **Preparing the Test Environment**: Set up a testing space where the user feels comfortable and where observations and recordings can be made without intrusion.
5. **Conducting the Test Sessions**: Have participants perform the tasks while observers take notes, record audio and video, and monitor task completion rates.
6. **Debriefing**: Discuss with participants to get more insights into their experience and any issues they faced.
7. **Analysis and Reporting**: Analyze the data collected, identify patterns and usability issues, and prepare a report with recommendations for improvement.

### Tools Used in Usability Testing:
- **Screen Recording Software**: Tools like Camtasia or OBS Studio can record test sessions.
- **Remote Testing Services**: Platforms like UserTesting, Lookback.io, or UsabilityHub facilitate remote and unmoderated usability testing.
- **Eye Tracking**: Hardware and software that tracks where and how long a user looks at certain areas on a screen.

### Importance of Usability Testing:
- Identifies usability problems before the product is marketed.
- Improves user satisfaction, which can lead to increased sales and customer loyalty.
- Reduces costs by identifying and fixing issues early in the development process, rather than after release.
- Helps ensure the product is useful and easy to use for the target audience.

Usability testing is a critical component of user-centered design and should be conducted throughout the development process, from early design to post-release. It ensures that the product meets the needs and expectations of its users, leading to a more successful product overall.
